# Methods log

Every change to how bignews.day collects or measures things, dated. A chart that crosses one of these dates should be
read with the change in mind. Newest first. Scores in the database carry `scored_by` (model plus a rubric hash) from
2026-10-03 on; earlier scores say `qwen3:8b rubric:pre-tracking`.

## 2026-10-04
- **Aggregators aren't outlets (#151).** Google News, Drudge Report, RealClearPolitics and Political Wire no longer count
  toward stories, lean, the news-day sticker or the cloud (they mostly link to other outlets' stories); their live
  headlines are matched to stories (embedding 0.7) and shown as "picked up by" on the cards.
- **Wire share (#152).** Outlet cards show the share of an outlet's news headlines over 7 days that are AP or Reuters
  headlines near word for word (embedding 0.90 and 70% of words shared; checked by hand). Outlets mostly rewrite wire
  copy: on Oct 4 the highest was about 11%.
- **Story snapshots and trend arrows (#133).** Every run saves each story's lean, mood and outlet count
  (story_snapshot). Cards show arrows when lean or mood moved over the last 6 hours (needs 2+ hours of history):
  lean 0.15 / 0.35 / 0.6, mood 0.1 / 0.25 / 0.45 for one, two or three arrows.
- **Bright side removed.** Its picks (hope/joy plus a "widely good news" model check) read as feel-good filler rather
  than a measure.
- **Blindspots move onto story cards.** Same rule; the separate box is gone. A blindspot's card shows a lean meter
  (left/center/right counts) with a tick where an average story splits, and a 🙈 filter shows only blindspots.
- **Transcription: temporary failures retry.** Out-of-memory and network errors are no longer recorded as failures
  (they stopped every item for good on the first prod run); only a missing or unreadable file is. Transcription
  waits for the language model to unload first and skips the round if it can't. The test suite no longer calls the
  real language model (it was loading it onto the shared GPU mid-transcription).
- **More shows.** News outlets' own daily podcasts shown (Reuters World News, BBC Global News, WSJ What's News,
  Bloomberg News Now, Politico Playbook, The Economist's Intelligence, CNN 5 Things, the Guardian's Today in Focus,
  Morning Wire); more political YouTube channels shown (Pakman, Secular Talk, Brian Tyler Cohen, MeidasTouch, TYT,
  Adam Mockler, Timcast IRL, Benny Johnson, Ben Shapiro, Dan Bongino, Matt Walsh). Archived only: ABC News Update
  (hourly), NBC Top Story, Al Jazeera's The Take, Steven Crowder, Candace Owens and long-form talk (Rogan, Theo Von,
  Flagrant, Jimmy Dore, PBD, Pod Save America's channel). 72 sources, 37 shown.
- **Headline changes: junk prefixes.** A rank from a "most read" list ("4 , ") or a view counter ("114.7k views : ")
  before a headline is stripped when scraping and ignored when comparing versions, so a story moving from #4 to #2
  is no longer a "change".
- **Headline changes: how a rewrite changed.** The language model reads both versions side by side and says, in a few
  words, what the rewrite changed ("added the death toll"), cached once per change. "Plainer wording" / "reads as
  better news" notes show only when that side-by-side reading and the two versions' own scores agree on the
  direction; either alone was noise (identical headlines came out "plainer").
- **Backups every run.** Each run first takes an online copy of the database (newest 5 kept), besides the nightly
  copies (30 days).
- **Trending ranks by what's on front pages now.** "Trending in the news" ranks stories by the share of outlets
  carrying them on their front page right now, weighted by age the same way as the news-day sticker (full weight
  for 12 hours, then halving every 24), instead of every outlet that covered them in the last day. A story outlets
  have dropped falls down the list. Items show both counts: on front pages now, and in all.
- **Sagas are kept across days.** Sagas are saved (saga table, story.saga_id). Each hour, today's stories are merged
  with the last 7 days of saved stories, starting from the saved sagas, so a saga grows or merges but never loses a
  part. Linking now needs a shared distinctive *name* (a word outlets capitalize mid-sentence) rather than any
  distinctive word, and hyphenated words split ("UK-Iranian" carries "Iranian"). Checked on Oct 3-4: Cornell keeps
  all 4 parts; a false link ("Trump rally in Alabama" with "Ohio layoffs before Trump rally", via "rally") is gone.
- **Podcast transcription.** Archived podcast audio is transcribed on our own GPU with Whisper (faster-whisper
  large-v3-turbo, int8), after each hourly build, hourly newscasts first, for items up to 3 days old. Sponsor reads
  at the start and end are trimmed. Transcripts are kept with the model's name, for analysis only.

## 2026-10-03 (evening)
- **Shows archive begins.** 40 newsletters, podcasts and political video channels are collected into side_item
  (append-only), each feed read at most every 2 hours with conditional requests. Sources are sorted by how they
  follow the news (news of the day vs. thinking, #135), not format; only news-of-the-day ones are shown on the site.
- **Stories: different money stays apart.** Headlines that both name dollar amounts more than 3x apart can't link
  ($90 Medicare checks vs. a $5,000 promise); $90 vs. "nearly $100" still can. Headlines without amounts unchanged.
- **Stories: a split story gets two titles.** When one saved story's coverage splits into two clusters in an hour,
  the bigger part keeps the story and its title and the smaller becomes a new story (before, both showed the same
  title).
- **Headline changes: live-blog filter.** Only an all-caps LIVE tag or phrases like "live updates" mark a live
  blog; the plain word "live" no longer does, so ordinary rewrites containing it now count.
- **Scraping.** Bare photo credits with no text left after cleaning are dropped; hrefs with stray spaces are kept.

## 2026-10-03
- **Score provenance.** Each scored headline now records which model and rubric version scored it, when, and the
  model's own note on who the event affects. The rubric id is a hash of the prompt and schema, so it changes on any
  edit to either.
- **Trend sightings.** Every appearance of a trend in a source's list is now logged with its rank (before this, only
  first and latest sightings were kept).
- **Outlet ratings.** Lean switched from MBFC to AllSides (5 levels, CC BY-NC 4.0); reliability from Wikipedia's
  perennial sources list (CC BY-SA 4.0). Outlets AllSides doesn't rate are left out of every lean average.
- **Our lean estimate.** Wording-only model (tf-idf + ridge) trained on rated outlets over 30 days; published only
  when leave-one-out rank agreement is 0.45+ and the outlet is 0.55+ from center. Never counted in lean averages.
- **Emotions.** Ranked top three per headline, averaged ranked-choice style (3:2:1). All headlines rescored with this
  rubric (14,404).
- **Stories and sagas.** Stories: headlines linked at embedding similarity 0.7+, six or more outlets, 24-hour lookback.
  Sagas: stories whose centers are 0.58+ similar and share a distinctive word.
- **News-day sticker.** Live headlines only; a story's weight is full for 12 hours, then halves every 24 hours.
- **Duplicates merged.** 2,470 duplicate articles and 1,468 duplicate headlines merged (backup kept).
- **New outlets.** 11 added from their feeds (TPM, Puck, The Washington Sun, The Lever, Mediaite, Straight Arrow
  News, UnHerd, Just the News, The Daily Signal, The American Conservative, Washington Reporter). Vox and National
  Review switched to their feeds.

## 2026-10-02
- **Archive begins.** The current database starts this day; anything earlier isn't in it.

## History
- **2024-01 to 2024-08: built by hand** as Maudlin: per-outlet scrapers, the database, the word cloud, word-list
  sentiment (VADER, AFINN). About 680 commits.
- **2026-10: rebuilt with AI assistance** (Anthropic's Claude as a coding assistant) for the 2026 midterms. The
  direction, design and decisions are the maintainer's; the assistant wrote and tested much of the new code.
  Separately, the site's measures come from a small open model run locally (see above for its provenance).

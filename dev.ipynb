      "    &lt;p&gt;A group of Republican lawmakers introduced legislation Thursday that would give the National Guard the power to use lethal force against \"armed invaders\" crossing the southern border into the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill, titled \"Defend Our Borders from Armed Invaders Act,\" was introduced by freshman Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-Texas, and has been referred to the Committee on Armed Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation, if passed, would authorize the National Guard to take \"such actions as may be necessary to repel persons attempting to enter the United States from Mexico who are carrying weapons, and for other purposes,\" according to a description of the bill. The full text of the legislation has not been made public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/take-back-border-convoy-arrives-texas-want-nation-saved\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'TAKE BACK OUR BORDER' CONVOY ARRIVES IN TEXAS: 'WE WANT OUR NATION SAVED'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL, said in a statement that the legislation is necessary to stop cartels and smugglers who are thriving at the \"wide-open border.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We’re seeing violent crime continually escalate at the border and flow into our communities, as President Biden’s policies have created an untenable national security crisis,\" Luttrell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This legislation is a step in the right direction to reign in this crime by providing the National Guard [with] the power to stop these armed individuals from crossing into the United States by any means necessary.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cartel members and people smugglers have been known to use weapons to transport illegal immigrants across the southern border as well as drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, Fox News obtained images showing suspected cartel gunmen coming across the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;U.S. southern border&lt;/a&gt; in Texas toting body armor and rifles. It is the same area where law enforcement arrested five suspected members of the Northeast Cartel in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News’ drone also captured images of &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/authorities-arrest-mexican-cartel-members-who-came-across-us-border-rifles\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;smugglers with machetes&lt;/a&gt; last summer hitting and threatening migrants at the edge of the river in Matamoros, Mexico, telling them to cross into &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Brownsville, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has taken several steps, including a collaborative law enforcement anti-smuggling campaign in 2022 that led to thousands of arrests, to crack down on cartel smuggling. It has also made over &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-slaps-sanctions-sinaloa-cartel-members-including-anthrax-monkey-part-anti-fentanyl-moves\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;170 sanctions designations&lt;/a&gt; of cartel leaders and members, often working with Mexico to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/musk-biden-opened-border-floodgates-democrats-can-stay-power\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MUSK SAYS BIDEN OPENED BORDER FLOODGATES SO DEMOCRATS CAN STAY IN POWER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move by Luttrell also comes as Texas is involved in a multipronged legal fight with the federal government on how to stem the unprecedented flow of illegal immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has seized state property along the Rio Grande in &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-again-rebuffs-dhs-demand-full-access-disputed-border-area\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Eagle Pass known as Shelby Park&lt;/a&gt; while the Biden administration won a Supreme Court decision that allows Border Patrol to cut razor wire the state erected. Texas has continued to fortify the border and has also indicated it will not comply with the administration’s demands for it to vacate the Shelby Park area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[President Biden's] actions have caused an unprecedented invasion that we must defend against,\" &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/greg-abbott\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Abbott said&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report for &lt;a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/doclib/eoy/iceAnnualReportFY2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;fiscal 2023&lt;/a&gt; shows that the number of illegal immigrants on the non-detained docket has soared from 3.7 million in FY 2021 to nearly 4.8 million in FY 2022 to nearly 6.2 million in FY 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill is being co-sponsored by Reps. Chuck Fleischman, R-Tenn., Chuck Edward, R-N.C, Brian Babin, R-Texas, Michael Guest, R-Miss., Mike Collin, Ga., and Brandon William, R-N.Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Adam Shaw, Griff Jenkins and Bill Melugin contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    Patrick Mahomes II will look to earn his third Super Bowl title next week. But his father, Pat Mahomes Sr., still believes a pair of Hall of Famers are still better than his son.\n",
      "   </description>\n",
      "   <content:encoded>\n",
      "    &lt;p&gt;Patrick Mahomes was drafted in the first round in 2017 and has been &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Chiefs'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; primary starting quarterback for the last six seasons. He is a two-time NFL MVP and has won a pair of Vince Lombardi Trophies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahomes has also thrown for more than 4,000 yards in every season he has been the full-time starter. Next week, the 28-year-old signal caller will make his fourth Super Bowl appearance. Mahomes' impressive resume has already drawn comparisons to former New England Patriots quarterback &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Tom Brady&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brady is widely considered the greatest player in NFL history, others argue that Mahomes has already reached the seven-time Super Bowl champion's level of greatness. But, Mahomes' father, Pat Mahomes Sr., is not quite ready to give his son the greatest of all-time title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That's still to be determined,\" the elder Mahomes said. \"He still has a ways to go. I have mad respect for Tom Brady and I grew up as a Joe Montana fan.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahomes Sr. did acknowledge that his son is heading in the right direction, but at this point, he would still give Brady and Montana the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[Patrick] is on the right trajectory, but right now, I would still say those guys are better.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-justin-reid-argues-patrick-mahomes-leagues-goat-probably-best-player-nfl-history\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHIEFS' JUSTIN REID ARGUES PATRICK MAHOMES IS LEAGUE'S GOAT: 'PROBABLY THE BEST PLAYER IN NFL HISTORY'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some similarities between Mahomes' path and Brady's and Montana's accomplishments when they were the same age as the Chiefs quarterback. Montana won his second &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/super-bowl\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in his late 20s, while Brady won three titles by the time he turned 28-years-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Brady nor Montana were named an &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-mvp-other-award-finalists-named-season-winds-down\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;NFL MVP&lt;/a&gt; until they were in their 30s. Mahomes earned his first league MVP trophy in 2018 and his second in 2022. It is important to point out that Montana played in a different era. The rules of the game were vastly different during his time and high-powered passing attacks were uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longtime Patriots team owner &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/patriots-robert-kraft-weighs-tom-brady-patrick-mahomes-comparisons\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Robert Kraft&lt;/a&gt; recently attended the MusiCares Gala to present Jon Bon Jovi with the Person of tht Year award. Kraft weighed in on the quarterback comparisons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They’re both off the charts. I had a personal relationship and great love for Tom Brady,\" Kraft told Fox News Digital on the red carpet. \"I think if Patrick is pretty special, and he can evolve and sustain the way Tom did – it looks like he’s on the path – that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"But what I’d also like about him is I’ve heard, and the little I’ve seen, he’s a great human being – the way Tommy’s off the charts. And that’s great for America, that two people who are so accomplished can be so good representatives to young people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady's longevity was unprecedented, and it is difficult to project whether Mahomes will be able to sustain excellence for more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chiefs defeated the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; inside a frigid Arrowhead Stadium in the wild-card round. Kansas City proceeded to beat the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round game, and the Baltimore Ravens in last week's conference title game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahomes will try and win his third ring when the Chiefs and &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; face off in Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas on February 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    Comedian Larry David said he would throttle Elmo again if he had the chance, telling NBC&amp;apos;s Seth Meyers: &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;apos;t take it&amp;quot;\n",

      "   <content:encoded>\n",
      "    &lt;p&gt;\"Seinfeld\" co-creator and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" star Larry David justified his beat down of \"Sesame Street\" puppet Elmo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David told \"Late Night\" host Seth Meyers that he assaulted the puppet on the \"Today\" set because he couldn’t take another second of his message about &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; and declared that he would try to hurt the puppet again if he could. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyers brought up the scuffle, saying, \"You were on the ‘Today’ show this morning. And so was Elmo. Elmo, one might say, loved by all. You wanna tell us what happened with Elmo, Larry?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-erupts-over-larry-davids-attack-elmo-joy-behar-defends-comedian-angry-colleagues\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘THE VIEW’ ERUPTS OVER LARRY DAVID’S ATTACK ON ELMO, JOY BEHAR DEFENDS COMEDIAN FROM ‘ANGRY’ COLLEAGUES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David appeared embarrassed and fumbled for his words as Meyers brought up the viral clip from the NBC morning show segment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the \"Today\" broadcast – as co-anchor Al Roker gave a brief weather report – the camera quickly cut to where the other anchors and guest Elmo were sitting on the couch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David could be seen grabbing Elmo’s face as the puppet screamed. &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/larry-david-accused-stunned-elon-musk-wedding-supporting-child-murder-book\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The comedian&lt;/a&gt; also took a swing at the character as the show hosts looked on in shock.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one more squeeze of Elmo’s face, David walked off the set smiling. The puppet screamed after him, \"Mr. Larry, Elmo liked you before!\" As the co-hosts processed the scene that just happened behind them, the puppet called back out to David, saying, \"Let’s get back on the couch and let’s talk about how you’re feeling!\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-host Savannah Guthrie told David, \"Larry, you’ve gone too far this time,\" to which he replied, \"Somebody had to do it.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/sesame-street-prompts-strong-reaction-pride-month-twitter-posts-happy-pride-elmo-loves-you\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SESAME STREET PROMPTS STRONG REACTION WITH PRIDE MONTH TWITTER POSTS: ‘HAPPY PRIDE! ELMO LOVES YOU!’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David made the same point when Meyers mentioned how he went to \"throttle\" Elmo. He said, \"Yeah, yeah. I did it, \"Elmo was talking, okay? I was waiting to be interviewed, and Elmo – he was going on about mental health and I had to listen to every word.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a high-pitched voice to mock the puppet, he continued, \"And I was going, ‘Oh my God, oh my God, I don’t think I can take another second of this!’\" Returning to his normal voice, he yelled, \"And so I got off my chair and I approached him and I throttled him!\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There you go,\" an amused Meyers remarked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I couldn’t take it!\" David said, adding, \"And you know what? I would do it again.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elmo altercation happened after the Sesame Street star went viral on X this week for asking his 500 thousand followers how they were feeling. The innocent question sparked a social media conversation on mental health that even &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-blasted-sharing-elmos-social-media-post-puppet-endorsing-another-puppet\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; felt was important enough to weigh in on. &lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; will soon launch a $53 million pilot program to hand out pre-paid credit cards to migrant families housed in hotels, according to a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/02/02/metro/nyc-to-hand-out-prepaid-credit-cards-to-migrant-families-for-food/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;, citing city records, reported that 500 migrant families at the Roosevelt Hotel will receive pre-paid cards to help them buy food. The program is intended to replace the current food service provided there, the Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Not only will this provide families with the ability to purchase fresh food for their culturally relevant diets and the baby supplies of their choosing, but the pilot program is expected to save New York City more than $600,000 per month, or more than $7.2 million annually,\" a spokesperson for New York City Mayor Eric Adams told the paper in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-migrant-flips-middle-fingers-charged-attacking-nypd-times-square\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ILLEGAL MIGRANT FLIPS MIDDLE FINGERS AFTER BEING CHARGED WITH ATTACKING NYPD IN TIMES SQUARE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-paid cards may only be used at bodegas, grocery stores, supermarkets and convenience stores. &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Migrants eligible&lt;/a&gt; for the program must sign an affidavit stating they will only spend the funds on food and baby supplies, or else they would lose access to the funds, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount available to each migrant family depends on their size and how much income they are receiving, according to the contract reviewed by the Post. A family of four might be provided nearly $1,000 each month, or $35 per day for food, the Post reported. The cards are replenished every 28 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey company Mobility Capital Finance has partnered with the city to run the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-republican-calls-hochul-adams-denounce-bidens-border-policy-migrant-crisis-big-apple\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK REPUBLICAN CALLS ON HOCHUL, ADAMS TO DENOUNCE BIDEN'S BORDER POLICY AMID MIGRANT CRISIS IN BIG APPLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"MoCaFi looks forward to partnering with New York City to disburse funds for asylum seekers to purchase fresh, hot food,\" MoCaFi CEO and founder Wole Coaxum told the Post. \"MoCaFi’s goal is to expand access to financial resources for individuals excluded from banking, such as asylum seekers, while helping the local economy.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City officials said that if the pilot program is a success with the initial 500 migrant families, it will be expanded to all migrant families staying in hotels, which is 15,000 currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 150,000 migrants have arrived in New York City since 2022, overwhelming city resources as officials have struggled to find housing for them. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-hits-major-milestone-for-migrants-sent-to-sanctuary-cities-despite-liberal-fury-we-will-not-back-down\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;bused asylum-seekers to New York&lt;/a&gt; and other cities in an effort to assist them in traveling to sanctuary jurisdictions and also highlight the crisis that border communities face on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/nypd-impounds-80-unlicensed-migrant-mopeds-roosevelt-watson-hotel-shelters\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYPD IMPOUNDS 80 UNLICENSED MIGRANT MOPEDS FROM OUTSIDE ROOSEVELT AND WATSON HOTEL SHELTERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Adams has decried the arrivals as a humanitarian crisis and said that providing food and housing for the migrants will cost the city about $12 billion over three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, the mayor traveled to &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/latin-america\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; on a tour to dissuade potential migrants in Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador from attempting to come to the city, saying the city is \"at capacity.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics, however, have said that New York City's sanctuary policies and handouts to migrants will only encourage more immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If I were promoting an event and wanted to attract the biggest possible crowd without worrying about losing money, I'd make admission free and give everyone complimentary pizza and beer,\" Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs, a Tennessee Republican and former WWE wrestler, posted on X, commenting on the New York Post report. \"That's kinda immigration policy right now.\"&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;A rowdy anti-Israel protest outside of Columbia University reportedly led to the arrests of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, who clashed with &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;NYPD officers&lt;/a&gt; and shouted anti-cop chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The \"All Out for Palestine\" demonstration began around 3 p.m. Friday evening, and footage of protesters waving Palestinian flags and scuffling with officers quickly spread across social media in the hours afterward, according to the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/probablyreadit/status/1753536635885506567?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;video shared to social media&lt;/a&gt;, the disgruntled group of protesters could be seen resisting commands from officers who were attempting to clear roadways, all while chanting, \"NYPD, KKK. IDF they’re all the same.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same clip, one individual is shown being detained by police. As officers attempted to wrangle another female protester, other demonstrators were &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;shown taunting officers&lt;/a&gt; and attempting to pull them from the woman. One individual, later identified as 31-year-old Fadi Shuman, was also shown in the clip taking an officer's peaked cap and running away with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-dad-who-confronted-anti-israel-protesters-felt-like-hostage-pro-palestinian-traffic-jam\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK DAD WHO CONFRONTED ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS FELT LIKE 'HOSTAGE' IN PRO-PALESTINIAN TRAFFIC JAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DCPI spokesperson for the city confirmed to Fox News Digital that three individuals had been arrested as a result of their &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;actions at the protest&lt;/a&gt;, and another 12 had been issued citations for disorderly conduct. Of the three people that were arrested, two received desk appearance tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shuman was &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;arrested and charged&lt;/a&gt; with grand larceny, obstructing governmental administration, aggravated harassment and criminal possession of stolen property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sara Elmilgi, 34, was also arrested and charged with harassment after she \"slapped an officer’s arms multiple times while he was lawfully attempting to guide her back to the sidewalk,\" according to the spokesperson. The officer did not sustain any injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other individual who was arrested, 47-year-old Jesse Pape, was charged with obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct after he \"was given a lawful order to disperse and refused to comply,\" the spokesperson noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/american-flag-torched-nyc-pro-palestinian-demonstrations\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICAN FLAG TORCHED DURING NYC PRO-PALESTINIAN DEMONSTRATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main protest on Friday was reportedly attended by hundreds of individuals. A smaller group of demonstrators later marched south to West 107th Street and Broadway, where additional arrests were made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"You are violent thugs. You are criminals! You are the most violent. You are the most f--king violent,\" one protester yelled at police while in custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It is right to rebel. NYPD, burn in hell! It is right to rebel. NYPD, burn in hell!\" others could be heard chanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who displayed a &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;poster of Israelis&lt;/a&gt; who had been kidnapped and chanted, \"Am Yisrael Chai,\" a Jewish solidarity anthem, was also surrounded by protesters who ripped the poster from her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Don’t you dare!\" the pro-Israel woman shouted just before cops intervened and separated her from the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration, as reported by the Post, came in response to claims that anti-Israel student protesters had been &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/columbia-students-attacked-chemical-during-pro-palestinian-protests\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;sprayed with an unknown chemical&lt;/a&gt; last month while marching through the university's campus. That incident led to two alleged assailants being banned from campus and an investigation by police into what exactly had happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Interim Provost Dennis A. Mitchell said the chemical incident \"appears to have been serious crimes, possibly hate crimes.\"&lt;/p&gt;\n",

He was rumored to be a candidate for the Washington Commanders job during the year but never interviewed for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belichick ended the whirlwind of the head coaching carousel as a free agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday night, Kraft hit the red carpet before the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;MusiCares Gala&lt;/a&gt; as he was set to honor Jon Bon Jovi with the Person of the Year Award. Fox News Digital asked Kraft what he thought about Belichick failing to latch onto a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His answer was short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/raiders-maxx-crosby-admits-recent-surgeries-struggle-optimistic-health\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAIDERS' MAXX CROSBY ADMITS RECENT SURGERIES HAVE 'BEEN A STRUGGLE,' BUT HE'S OPTIMISTIC FOR HIS HEALTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Well, he’s pretty special,\" Kraft said. \"We were lucky to have him for a quarter of a century.

I think we were the only ones who had those expectations, and I think it’s safe to say we exceeded them.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;Three people were injured Saturday by a man armed with a knife and hammer inside a bustling &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;French train&lt;/a&gt; station, with police ruling out terrorism and suggesting the suspect may have mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack occurred in the Gare de Lyon rail station in Paris at around 7:35 a.m. where one person suffered serious stomach wounds and was rushed to the hospital to undergo surgery. The victim’s injuries are life-threatening, police say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other two victims suffered light wounds, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;police say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 32-year-old suspect has been taken into custody. The suspected assailant's motive was not immediately clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/paris-stabbing-suspect-released-prison-previous-islamic-terror-plot-french-minister\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARIS STABBING SUSPECT WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER PREVIOUS ISLAMIC TERROR PLOT: FRENCH MINISTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French media reports the man is from Mali &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;in Africa&lt;/a&gt;, while police say he was carrying residency papers from Italy and medicines suggesting he was undergoing treatment. The papers allow him to travel legally to other European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This individual appears to suffer from psychiatric troubles,\" said Laurent Nunez, the Paris police chief who is also in charge of the massive security operation for this year’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/olympics\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in the city which will run from July 26 through August 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While stressing that the police investigation was still in its early stages, Nunez said: \"There are no elements that lead us to think that this could be a terrorist act.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/protests-french-teens-fatal-stabbing-leads-calls-crackdown-far-right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROTESTS OVER FRENCH TEEN’S FATAL STABBING LEAD TO CALLS FOR CRACKDOWN ON ‘FAR-RIGHT'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passersby intervened to help railway police officers detain the suspect, Nunez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack took place in one of the station’s cavernous halls, authorities said. Millions of passengers ride the transport hub’s high-speed trains that link Paris to other cities and its commuter train services to the suburbs and towns in the Paris region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators are analyzing the knife and hammer, the Paris prosecutor’s office said. It said the police investigation is looking at a potential preliminary charge of attempted murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin described the attack as an \"unbearable act\" and thanked those who detained the assailant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been several knife attacks in France recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, a Chechen immigrant on France's extremist watchlist allegedly &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/knife-wielding-attacker-shouts-allahu-akbar-kills-teacher-french-school-amid-hamas-israel-war-report\"&gt;stabbed a teacher to death&lt;/a&gt; and wounded two others in a suspected terror attack, while in June, a Syrian refugee armed with a knife &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/syrian-refugee-injures-4-children-adult-knife-attack-french-alps-annecy-report\"&gt;stabbed four young children&lt;/a&gt; and injured two adults by a lake in the French Alps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January of last year, at least six people were injured in an attack at &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/paris-train-station-attacker-shot-injuring-six-bladed-weapon\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Paris’ Gare Du Nord train station.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

My life was forever changed for the better the day I met Carl Weathers. Rest in power and keeping punching,\" the three-time Academy Award nominee captioned his touching social media post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, Stallone was seen standing in front of a painting depicting a fight between Rocky and Creed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued, \"Carl Weathers was such an integral part of my life, my success, everything about it.

      "    Commentator Van Jones argued that Biden faces a serious electoral challenge with regaining the trust of Muslim and Arab American voters since the eruption of war in Gaza.\n",
      "   </description>\n",
      "   <content:encoded>\n",
      "    &lt;p&gt;Former Obama official Van Jones warned on Thursday that Biden has his \"work cut out for him\" trying to regain the trust of young, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/american-arabs-muslims-refuse-meet-biden-campaign-director-key-battleground-state\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Arab and Muslim voters&lt;/a&gt; who object to his support of Israel amid the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Biden is facing an electoral revolt among Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan who are outraged by his ongoing support for Israel, with some even accusing him of enabling genocide. Arab Americans living in Michigan have traditionally been reliable Democrats, with Biden carrying over 75% of the vote in the Arab-majority city of Dearborn in 2020. That voting block is now under threat, however, with some members of the community launching an \"abandon Biden\" campaign in protest of his handling of Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday night’s episode of CNN’s Erin Burnett OutFront focused heavily on Biden’s attempts to regain the trust of Arab American voters by visiting Michigan in person. It featured students who would be voting for the first time as well as a former field organizer for the Biden campaign who said he will not vote for the president again, viewing him as complicit in Palestinian deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/aoc-reacts-biden-being-labeled-genocide-joe-far-left-young-people-appalled\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AOC REACTS TO BIDEN BEING LABELED 'GENOCIDE JOE' BY FAR LEFT: 'YOUNG PEOPLE ARE APPALLED'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if he was concerned if such a move would help re-elect former President Donald Trump, the former Biden campaign staffer said, \"It probably will. \"We have seen four years of Trump and we have seen four years of Biden and people don’t really see a difference between the presidents.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-obama-official-tells-biden-stay-hidden-doesnt-inspire-confidence\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Burnett turned to Jones&lt;/a&gt; and asked about the former campaign staffer that had turned on Biden over his foreign policy in Gaza. Burnett recalled how he had told their CNN reporter in Michigan \"that he will not vote for Biden again even knowing that it may help Trump. He says Biden is ‘not somebody I can trust.’ How big of a problem is this for Biden right now, Van?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-people-turn-genocide-joe-cease-fire-stance-biden-absolutely-sucks\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUNG PEOPLE TURN ON ‘GENOCIDE JOE’ OVER HIS CEASE-FIRE STANCE: BIDEN 'ABSOLUTELY SUCKS'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It’s a big problem for him right now,\" Jones replied. \"There are four syllables that are aimed at him. ‘&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-abortion-rally-virginia-interrupted-multiple-protesters-genocide-joe\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Genocide Joe&lt;/a&gt;.’ That is becoming something you’re hearing from the younger people, the younger voters in the Arab American community.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then added that while Biden can turn it around, it will take serious effort to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I think that he can turn it around, but you’ve got to be honest right now. You’ve got disappointment in the base with how he’s handling the war in Gaza,\" Jones said. \"Now, the reality is Joe Biden has deep ties and long friendships in the Muslim community, Arab community. He can get back there but he’s got his work cut out for him right now.\"&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "   </title>\n",
      "   <description>\n",
      "    The future is now, at least for Elon Musk’s Neuralink. It&amp;apos;s the latest tech that helps humans get smarter. But will it also help humans become more moral? That&amp;apos;s the key question.\n",
      "   </description>\n",
      "   <content:encoded>\n",
      "    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Elon Musk just announced that Neuralink —&lt;/a&gt; a \"brain-computer interface\" — had been implanted into a human brain for the first time. Patient Zero is recovering well. The technology has already undergone animal trials and has been branded as a Fitbit for the brain. Paired with your iPhone, a Neuralink could help control prosthetics, monitor brain activity in real time and boost overall cognitive capacity. It will eventually pair seamlessly with a Tesla, I’m sure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuralink is only the latest in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;line of novel technologies&lt;/a&gt; that can advance our cognitive capacities. Brain stimulation technologies have been shown to increase attention and boost creativity. The drug propranolol can modify memories. Other drugs such as Adderall and Modafinal — while used widely to treat ADHD — can be used to enhance cognition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a favorite of mine: optogenetics, a technique that makes neurons fire when they are exposed to light. Yes, there’s a big issue getting a flashlight into your cranium. But if we can do that, the technique presents all kinds of possibilities for cognitive enhancement. Flip a switch and watch your IQ tick up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/andrew-yang-warns-us-not-doing-enough-prepare-for-ais-impact-dramatic-changes\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDREW YANG WARNS US 'NOT DOING ENOUGH' TO PREPARE FOR AI'S IMPACT: 'DRAMATIC CHANGES'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive enhancement does not only take our thinking up a notch — it also &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;may help us understand moral concerns&lt;/a&gt; that are opaque to us now. Think of it this way: your dog has very little appreciation of morality. Sure, maybe he can understand that snacking on Thanksgiving dinner before the meal makes him a \"very, very bad dog.\" And that letting the neighbor kids pet him even though (you’ll admit) they are kind of annoying makes him a \"good dog.\"  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But try chatting with Fido about rights or equality or the ethics of technology, and you’ll get a blank stare. Why? There are probably a few reasons. The most obvious: a human adult has a more sophisticated intellect, and so is better able to appreciate and understand morality than a dog ever could.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My point? Our cognitively enhanced future cousins may stand in relation to us as we stand in relation to our dogs. Better able to appreciate moral nuances that escape us because of our cognitive inferiority. Dumbfounded in the face of moral considerations that, at our current cognitive level, simply do not click.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: none of this would actually make us more moral. The boosted IQ, the sharper memory, the greater appreciation of moral concerns. None of it. The reason is simple. Merely understanding morality does not make you morally better.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two thousand years ago, Aristotle had a word for this: akrasia, knowing the right thing to do but lacking the will to do it. Just because our future, enhanced cousins may understand and appreciate morality better does not mean they’ll act any better. They very well may know the right thing to do — and know it better than we do — but then choose to do something else entirely. That’s Aristotle’s lesson.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, the University of California, Riverside professor Eric Schwitzgebel has made the same point in a different way: through a series of studies about the moral behavior of ethicists. Presumably, ethicists know more about morality than your average Joe. They study ethics all day, after all. And yet, in study after tongue-in-cheek study, Schwitzgebel has shown professional ethicists to be not any better — or a bit worse — than the rest of us.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional ethicists fail to return library books more often than others, vote at a comparable rate to peers, talk at the same rate during other professors’ talks, and leave trash behind in meeting rooms at the same rate as anyone else.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this make ethicists moral monsters? Obviously not. But it does suggest that simply knowing more about morality won’t make you a better person. That goes for professional ethicists. It goes for our enhanced future cousins. And it goes for us, too — the unenhanced masses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, though, we didn’t need either Aristotle or Schwitzgebel to show us this. Being smarter doesn’t make you more moral. We’ve all known the wicked smart jerk, the GPA-crushing roommate who is impossible to live with, the genius with the soured personality.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, any moral outlook that recognizes the equal dignity of all humans suggests there is something obscene about assuming that moral worth tags along with IQ. This would imply, after all, that those with a lower IQ are morally inferior. A clear violation of human dignity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how could we become better morally? One possibility: when it comes to enhancement technologies, skip smarts and go right for morality. Forget about enhancing IQ and instead target empathy. Or altruism. Or simply those traits associated with a sunny disposition. There’s some chance this could work.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it did, our enhanced future cousins could be tweaked so they would not only know more than us about morality, but have a better moral compass. There’s a problem: a moral compass is only good if you want to follow where it points. And it isn’t clear how any form of enhancement could convince people to go where their enhanced compass is pointing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The better way forward? The tried-and-true paths that are available to us right now. Study trusted moral advice and aim to live it out; engage in your local communities; learn to appreciate the beautiful and allow your vision of it inform your life; engage in religious practice; seek out solid education; serve the poor, the vulnerable, the underserved.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the path to moral sainthood, and it is a path that has neither been undermined nor surpassed by Neuralink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/person/v/joseph-vukov\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOSEPH VUKOV&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;The WAGs of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; are sticking together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor Swift has been on all of our televisions and social media feeds way more often than usual over the last few months, thanks to her relationship with &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/travis-kelce\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Travis Kelce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pop sensation and All-Pro tight end have been dating since near the beginning of the football season, and Swift has been to a dozen of her boyfriend's games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the relationship has grown more serious, so have her airtime and the hate she's been receiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Chiefs making the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/super-bowl\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, there was speculation that Swift's relationship with Kelce, leading to increased popularity for the football star, added pressure to him and his teammates, causing a rather subpar regular season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, they shut up everyone by making their fourth Super Bowl in five years, but that hasn't stopped trolls from ripping Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prompted &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;NBA Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt; Charles Barkley to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you’re screaming at Taylor Swift saying she ruined [football], you’re just a loser.

Mahomes and Kelce have become maybe the best duo in NFL history since Mahomes took over in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Mahomes shared Barkley's quip and echoed the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Let. Them. Know,\" she wrote on her Instagram story, via the &lt;a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/02/02/sports/brittany-mahomes-has-three-word-response-if-you-hate-taylor-swift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift is expected to be at the Super Bowl despite having a concert in Tokyo the night before, but with Tokyo being 17 hours behind the site of the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, she can be in southern Nevada over 24 hours before kickoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chiefs will face the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;, a rematch of the Super Bowl four years ago, on February 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

The Eagles won that game, 21-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boycott could turn awkward if the two run into each other though.

      "    &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people of various faiths from around the world attended the third annual &lt;a href=\"https://irfsummit.org/\"&gt;International Religious Freedom Summit&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of shining a light on religious liberty around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, roughly 200 of the attendees were under the age of 25, with the youngest in attendance being 16 years old. Dr. Nguyễn Dinh Thang, the International Religious Freedom Summit’s Youth Chair, says young advocates have fresh brains and open minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If we don't cultivate youth now to get them ready, to take over the leadership of this campaign of this movement, then we are not going anywhere. The anti-movement will [grow],\" Thang told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/faith-god-higher-power-on-rise-among-young-americans-wake-covid-pandemic-poll\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAITH IN GOD OR 'HIGHER POWER' ON THE RISE AMONG YOUNG AMERICANS IN WAKE OF COVID PANDEMIC: POLL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A George Washington University student, Kinan Abdelnour, is volunteering for his second year at the summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told Fox News Digital that there needs to be greater youth involvement specifically concerning religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We see a lot of it where there’s a great deal of advocacy, advocacy coming towards like human rights in general. And people don't really like specifically talking about [religious freedom]. Like this is a very . . . niche problem that's occurring in the world,\" says Abdelbour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict, protests have erupted on college campuses nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syrian native Abdelbour says the act of protest within itself should not be taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I look at it as regardless of where their position is, it's a blessing that they can push, because in Syria, if you push for either side, you get killed. . . . In America, we're lucky that we can have this freedom of protest and assembly and speech. So for me, I kind of see that, right or wrong, I think it's &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion\"&gt;a blessing&lt;/a&gt; that we're able to have this,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/college-campus-protests-erupt-across-us-ahead-anticipated-israel-operation-gaza\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLLEGE CAMPUS PROTESTS ERUPT ACROSS US AHEAD OF ANTICIPATED ISRAEL OPERATION IN GAZA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Rehak, ambassador and special envoy for Holocaust, Interfaith Dialogue, and Freedom of Religion in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, became involved in &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion\"&gt;religious freedom&lt;/a&gt; because he is now \"on the other side\" and feels responsibility to help those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rehak was a teenager in the late 1980s when the communist state police came to his school and told him not to share or speak about his &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith\"&gt;religious beliefs&lt;/a&gt; after attending a lecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I came to my school, and there were two police cars, and . . . they came because of me. I was also [in] danger, because I heard on the radio that there were some people killed, and [saw] black [body] bags . . . and I didn't want to be in the plastic bag,\" he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rehak added \"This was my first [experience] . . . [I was] actually very frightened because the communists didn't want anybody to be interested in how to practice religion…and then came the revolution.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/chinese-pastor-communism-warns-america-descending-dark-reality-leftist-censorship\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE PASTOR WHO FLED COMMUNISM WARNS AMERICA IS DESCENDING INTO 'DARK REALITY' WITH LEFTIST CENSORSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mervyn Thomas, CEO of CSW, a &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; Human Rights Advocacy organization and chair of the U.K. based Freedom of Religion or Belief Forum (UK FoRB), says it is important to include younger generations in the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas says two seats are reserved for those between the ages of 20 and up to 30 on the FoRB main board to make sure not only are their voices being heard, but also that they are getting involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I’m really just passionate to bring young people into this space because . . . what's happening around the world &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/united-nations/human-rights\"&gt;is horrendous . . . &lt;/a&gt;and the world doesn’t know about this,\" he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/students-deserve-know-shocking-truth-communism\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STUDENTS DESERVE TO KNOW THIS SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT COMMUNISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas believes that the cause of religious freedom should take a page out of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/climate-change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; movement's book on how awareness is being shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I have got, you know, people of my age, have got no idea how to use all of the social media platforms. We need to harness all of those methods to tell the world this is horrific, in the same way that over the years has been done with, the environment and the green issues . . . people like Greta Thunberg, young people who are the face of this,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annie McKinney, one of the youngest members of the Board of Trustees at the Parliament of the World’s Religions, shared a similar sentiment: \"I say take a look at pop culture. . . . You have what's going on in Israel and Palestine right now. You have the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/nigeria-schoolgirls-82-chibok-girls-were-swapped-for-5-boko-haram-commanders\"&gt;BringBackOurGirls&lt;/a&gt; campaign . . . that you saw an influx of youth tweeting out. But the movement never captured those people who were so involved and interested in those topics . . . so social media is one key way to go about it,\" said McKinney.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    It’s common to think of owls as wise. Where did this idea originate and why do we often call older people &amp;quot;wise old owls&amp;quot;? Here&amp;apos;s a deep dive into the bird, the natural world and more.\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;Folklore says owls are wise, but are they, really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s commonplace to understand that owls are nocturnal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But where did the wisdom characteristic of &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/birds\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;these birds&lt;/a&gt; originate — and why have we transferred that trait to humans who live long lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/quiz-name-bird-match-beautiful-birds\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUIZ! NAME THAT BIRD! CAN YOU MATCH THESE BEAUTIFUL BIRDS WITH THEIR CORRECT NAMES?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of owls as wise birds has its roots in Ancient Greece and mythology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Owls have enthralled humanity for centuries, earning a reputation for wisdom that persists into modern society,\" said Chad Witko, senior coordinator, avian biology of the National Audubon Society's Migratory Bird Initiative, who is based in Windham County, Vermont. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some cultures view owls differently, many — including Western traditions — consider them symbols of wisdom, said Witko. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This perception finds roots partially in Ancient Greece, where Athena, the goddess of wisdom, is often depicted with an owl symbolizing her ability to see the whole truth,\" he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perception of wisdom is deeply rooted in their &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science/biology\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;biology, behavior&lt;/a&gt; and striking appearance, he also said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many birds with eyes on the sides of their heads, owls have forward-facing eyes set against a flat facial disc of feathers, resembling a human or child-like face, Witko told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Their &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vision-and-hearing\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;large, fixed eyes&lt;/a&gt; and ability to rotate their heads up to 270 degrees give owls an appearance of attentiveness and observance,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/exotic-animals-across-america\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE TO HAVE CLOSE-UP ENCOUNTERS WITH EXOTIC ANIMALS ACROSS AMERICA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’ve seen a perched owl, he said, \"it is hard not to view them looking at us, peering through us as they sit calmly and take in the world with undivided attention.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owls possess remarkable hunting abilities, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;navigating the darkness&lt;/a&gt; with silent grace, said Witko. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They boast specially adapted feathers that allow them to approach their prey undetected, while acute hearing helps them pinpoint movement in the open, under vegetation or beneath a layer of snow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Despite these attributes, scientific studies on owl intelligence are limited compared to studies on birds like parrots, starlings and corvids,\" he noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"These birds are social creatures, which often equates to larger brains and higher intelligence to communicate with each other and build social systems.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bald-eagle-brief-history-great-conservation-success-story-americas-bird\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BALD EAGLE: A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CONSERVATION SUCCESS STORY OF AMERICA'S BIRD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owls by nature are largely solitary outside the breeding season — and much of this bird's brain is dedicated to increased abilities to see and hear and much less for problem-solving or social building, Witko told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owls are adaptable birds and can live in &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;many types of habitats&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're found all over the world, from the Arctic to the tropics, and are able to survive in environments that would be difficult for other animals to live in, according to Medium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Owls inhabit diverse habitats worldwide, on every continent except Antarctica, from the Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests, even major cities, with 247 species recognized globally,\" said Witko. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States and Canada regularly host nearly 20 species, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where they're found, owls today face numerous conservation challenges — including habitat loss, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; and exposure to pesticides and rodenticides, said Witko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bird-feeding-is-not-just-birds-may-be-good-human-soul-researchers\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIRD FEEDING IS NOT JUST FOR THE BIRDS BUT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE HUMAN SOUL, TOO, RESEARCHERS SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Understanding their movements through tracking technologies aids conservation efforts,\" he said. \"By learning more about owl migration, we can better conserve these majestic birds and the ecosystems they inhabit.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References to owls as being wise are found in everything from Homer's \"The Iliad\" to \"Winnie the Pooh\" by A.A. Milne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s true they're &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/hunting\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;standout hunters&lt;/a&gt; in the food chain, owls probably aren’t any smarter than a lot of other birds, noted Mental Floss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study even revealed that the species of great gray owls repeatedly failed a simple cognitive test — pulling a string to get a treat — that several other bird species had solved successfully, the same source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, though owls may not possess the intelligence of some birds or be wise in a human sense, Witko told Fox News Digital their unique adaptations and ecological importance make them \"invaluable symbols of the natural world.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the folklore surrounding the assumption that owls are wise is spun from the nursery rhyme \"A Wise Old Owl.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reads: \"A wise old owl lived in an oak. The more he saw, the less he spoke / The less he spoke, the more he heard. Why can’t we all be like that wise old bird?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In American culture, there remains an association between &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/longevity\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;wisdom and aging&lt;/a&gt; — which has its basis in biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As humans age, the mind further develops — a direct byproduct of having lived longer and experienced more things, Psychology Today indicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Older people are usually more proficient than young people in certain dimensions of cognition — particularly those that involve different ways to solve problems, as well as life planning and making future goals,\" said the same source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "   </title>\n",
      "   <description>\n",
      "    Shakespeare warned, &amp;apos;Neither a borrower nor a lender be.’ He was on to something. Here are the 5 rules you can apply when asked to lend money to family or friends.\n",
      "   </description>\n",
      "   <content:encoded>\n",
      "    &lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, I learned a lesson about lending money the hard way. A relative of mine hit &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;difficult times in their finances&lt;/a&gt; and asked me for a $10,000 loan. You might be familiar with the situation. The family hit hard times, mostly from their own doing. Job layoff. Financially damaging relationship. Overspending on luxury goods and trips they couldn’t afford. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why ask me for a loan? Or better yet, why not me? They knew &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/investment\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;my family was having financial success.&lt;/a&gt; They knew we had just bought a big house. Nobody ever takes your money as seriously as their own money.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget what he asked me. \"I just need a small loan of $10,000 to get me through this patch and I promise that I’ll repay you in the next few months.\" With one of the biggest mistakes of my life, I told him yes to the $10,000 loan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/almost-60-parents-still-giving-adult-kids-money-while-majority-adult-kids-live-home-survey\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALMOST 60% OF PARENTS STILL GIVING THEIR ADULT KIDS MONEY, WHILE MAJORITY OF ADULT KIDS LIVE AT HOME: SURVEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No thank you note. No thank you e-mail. No follow up after my money hit his bank account. A few months later, things just got weirder. No follow-up. No payback plans. No communication at all. &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting/family\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;At our family Thanksgiving festivities,&lt;/a&gt; not even a mention of the loan at all.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I kept thinking was, \"when is he going to just tell me where we are at and when I’ll get my money back?\" After Thanksgiving and beyond … just crickets. From that point forward, our relationship became increasingly strained to the point that he never recovered financially, and I never recovered emotionally. So, we just don’t talk anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some rules to follow for loans with friends or family: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopt a Nancy Reagan '80s slogan of, \"Just Say No!\" It is best to tell people you don’t have it; you can’t afford it, or you simply don’t want to jeopardize your relationship with them. Those answers will solve 90% of the problems you’ll have with loaning people money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll feel better if you just call it what it is, which is a gift. If it is a gift, then you don’t quite have the same level of pressure because, essentially, you are saying that you’ll give somebody money with no strings attached. That means you could be helping a friend through a tough time or a family member who is having trouble paying for their kids’ college. You might feel better about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it official. The challenge becomes when you do an unofficial loan. This means you may not be clear about the terms of the loan (i.e. interest rate, repayment terms). Now, imagine this scenario. You loan money to a friend or a family member (much like an \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" episode), and then they book themselves a four-day trip to Las Vegas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, every time you see them at any event, you’ll always be wondering in the back of your head … \"When am I going to get my money back?\" You should get a legal contract in place in terms of a promissory note, so you have documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s business now, get ready for the relationship to be strained if they miss payments. If the loan goes south and your friend cannot pay it back, how will you handle the relationship going forward? Almost 50% of the adults who lent money to friends or family report having a negative outcome, 37% said that they lost money, and 21% experienced a damaged relationship with the borrower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No co-signing a loan. Period.  When you co-sign a loan, it isn’t just about lending your credit reputation to help somebody else. It’s an actual financial commitment and a promise to repay their loan if they are unable to do so. This could include late fees, collection costs, and potentially wreak havoc on your credit score. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you keep hearing the line from someone that you loaned money, \"Don’t worry, I’ll repay you soon!\" You might just get caught between whether you write off the loan or write off the friendship.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/person/j/ted-jenkin\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY TED JENKIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

Most pedestrians keep their eyes trained straight ahead as they walk past clouds of fentanyl smoke or slumped figures with lolling heads. Maybe they cross the street or look sidelong at someone who starts shouting or throwing things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nikki is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/crisis-northwest-voters-beyond-turning-point-decades-progressive-politics\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: ARE VOTERS 'BEYOND A TURNING POINT' AFTER DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Are you okay?

It happened to one of her friends, a man in his mid-20s who appeared to be sleeping, but had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They were gonna have a lot of life left,\" she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon has turned into a battlefield in the war over drug policy since the state became the first to decriminalize drug possession. Nearly 60% of voters approved Measure 110 but, three years later, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/voters-remorse-blue-state-survey-shows-majority-want-re-criminalize-drugs-made-enormous-mistake\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;numerous polls&lt;/a&gt; suggest they regret that move. And no other states have followed Oregon's lead, despite assurances from researchers and decriminalization advocates that the law is not responsible for increased addiction, overdoses and crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State lawmakers are poised to re-criminalize drug possession in a special legislative session that begins Monday, though Democrats and Republicans have drafted competing bills. And Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek declared a 90-day state of emergency this week in downtown Portland, where the fentanyl crisis has been most pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our country and our state have never seen a drug this deadly and addictive, and all are grappling with how to respond,\" Kotek, a Democrat, said in a release. \"We are all in this together.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/digital-originals\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl strikes fear among even longtime drug users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is creating zombies,\" Lori, a homeless woman &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/homeless-encampments-remain-portland-despite-tent-ban-bulls\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;in Portland&lt;/a&gt;, told Fox News last summer. \"This sh-- should be illegal because they're killing the mentally ill for a dollar a pill, because I guarantee ya, all these people have some kind of mental illness.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Dusek, who uses marijuana and meth, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They’re incoherent most of the time, they’re babbling about something to themselves quite loudly, like they can’t hear themselves,\" said Dusek, who has been homeless off and on since 1992. \"They’re like living dead.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/let-serve-warning-anarchists-claim-responsibility-burning-car-outside-city-leaders-home\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;'LET THIS SERVE AS A WARNING': ANARCHISTS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR BURNING CAR OUTSIDE CITY LEADER'S HOME&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overdose deaths in the state surged from 800 in 2020 to 1,394 in 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The overwhelming majority of fatal overdoses are now attributed to fentanyl, according to Oregon health data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It seems like we got all of Oregon coming, just to pick up fentanyl now,\" Dusek said of Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decriminalization advocates point out that fatal overdoses surged across the country beginning in early 2020, not just in Oregon. Many analysts attribute the spike to isolation and despair during the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikki said she has revived 32 people in the past year, collecting as many &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/college-students-get-free-naloxone-fentanyl-test-strips-schools-prevent-drug-overdoses\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;doses of naloxone&lt;/a&gt; as she can from clinics, shelters and even places where citizens have \"just nailed a box to a tree or to a wall and keep it stocked with Narcan.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most fentanyl users Fox News spoke to were difficult — if not impossible — to understand. One woman chattered breathlessly while absently sorting syringes inside her tent, one hand protected by a blue latex glove. A 27-year-old man muttered that he was originally from Idaho, then lived on the Yakama Indian Reservation before a family member dropped him off in Portland so he could \"live homeless and do drugs.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Most of them are mentally ill, and the families don't wanna take care of them,\" Lori said. \"Or they're sick and old and their families don't take care of 'em.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methamphetamine was historically Oregon’s drug of choice. But around 2018, law enforcement started to see a trickle of fentanyl, and then a surge, outpacing cocaine, heroin and meth. The small blue pills looked like Oxycodone and were filling the void left after states cracked down on opioid prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they were cheap to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It doesn't take a whole lot of fentanyl to meet the supply side for particular users to give them the effects that they want,\" said Chris Gibson, executive director of the Oregon-Idaho High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of pills law enforcement seized soared from about 100,000 in 2019, to more than 3 million in 2022, according to HIDTA's annual report. And while preliminary data from 2023 shows the increase in pill seizures slowing, powder seizures more than tripled last year. Police who participate in the HIDTA reported finding more than 180 kg (nearly 400 lbs) of fentanyl powder, Gibson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When you start thinking about the fact that it's estimated that two milligrams of fentanyl is a lethal dose to a new user&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; we start seeing the dangers of that,\" Gibson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingredients to make fentanyl are typically shipped from China to Mexico, Gibson said, then the finished product makes its way up the I-5 corridor from border to border, fanning out along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Oregon can't control the southern border, but we have Honduran cartel members all in our urban areas pushing deadly fentanyl,\" &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/focus-merit-oregon-county-axes-diversity-office-cost-nearly-1-million-year\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Clackamas County Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; Ben West said. \"We can't control that. But that costs Oregonians lives, and it causes a lot of criminality and despair.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Oregon can control its drug policies, West said, and \"elections have consequences.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure 110 made possession of user amounts of all drugs, including fentanyl, a Class E violation, punishable by a $100 fine that could be waived if the suspect called a hotline and completed a treatment assessment. But it quickly became apparent that drug users were not calling the hotline or paying the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other major part of the law — and one that many decriminalization critics want to keep — was redirecting a large chunk of the state's marijuana tax revenue to pay for addiction services, theoretically improving access to treatment. But that rollout was beleaguered by bureaucratic flubs and a tight implementation timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon approved $264 million in grants for more than 200 service providers as of December, according to the most recent audit from the &lt;a href=\"https://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=215067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secretary of State’s office,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which found issues with oversight and noted it has been difficult to demonstrate the new law's effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Oregon voters feel duped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I voted for it because I thought it would reclassify drug crimes and allow people to get into treatment, and then it would be treatment-focused,\" &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/portlands-crime-crisis-soros-backed-da-creating-lawless-free-mentality-trial-attorney-says\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Kristin Olson&lt;/a&gt;, an attorney and host of the Rational in Portland podcast, previously told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the majority of users who take advantage of Measure 110 funds are accessing harm reduction supplies like clean needles, pipes and Naloxone. Residential treatment and detox centers were not prioritized in grant spending, raising alarm among some providers, according to a recent audit of the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In Oregon, it's really easy to get high and really, really hard to get treatment,\" West said. \"You would think we would want to reverse that culturally.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providers that \"required sobriety for housing or supportive employment\" were more likely to have their grant applications denied for not being \"in line\" with the spirit of the law, the audit also found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There's a lot of money that is being put into out of sight, out of mind programs,\" said Matt Maceira, who suffered from addiction and frequent homelessness for 27 years. \"The money's wasted is what I'm saying.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting sober, Maceira founded Be Bold Street Ministries, a Christ-centered nonprofit. Volunteers can often be found praying with those living in one of Oregon's biggest encampments, just across the Wilamette River from the state capitol. They tell them about shelter and detox options and, on a cold Friday in January, helped a 28-year-old meth user call and register for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maceira opposed Measure 110 from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The decriminalization of deadly, mind-altering substances — you know what that will never produce? Decreased crime, increased public safety and lives saved,\" he said. \"But that's what was promised.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said drug use is rampant at the low-barrier shelters prioritized by Measure 110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"People are dying in those places. I've done celebrations-of-life services for people that have overdosed at low-barrier shelters,\" he said, adding that he would rather see providers require sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/portland-leaders-frustrated-say-city-allowed-set-harsher-rules-cigarettes-fentanyl-insane\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PORTLAND LEADERS FRUSTRATED, SAY CITY ALLOWED TO SET HARSHER RULES FOR CIGARETTES THAN FENTANYL: ‘IT’S INSANE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Letting people use methamphetamine, fentanyl and heroin or any other deadly substance is not compassionate,\" he said. \"Having a rule that says, 'Hey, government money is paying for this, you can't use drugs here,' is a really loving message. Like, I actually care about you. I don't want to see you be another statistic.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats, who control both chambers of the state legislature, have signaled they want to make drug possession a &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/open-air-drug-use-overdoses-push-democrats-introduce-overhaul-first-nation-decriminalization-law\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Class C misdemeanor&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest crime classification available in the state. Their proposal offers numerous off-ramps for those caught with drugs to avoid charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans, meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blue-state-republicans-move-strike-catastrophic-drug-law-say-wreaking-havoc-communities\"&gt;released a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would make possession of drugs like fentanyl, heroin and meth a Class A misdemeanor and would require treatment to avoid jail. If convicted, drug users could face up to a year behind bars, a $6,250 fine, or both. They argue the stiffer penalties are necessary to incentivize people to get clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers will meet for a short session beginning February 5. It’s not clear whether the sides can compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We’re not looking to put a Band-Aid on something,\" GOP Rep. Lucetta Elmer said. \"We’re looking to actually see effective change.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elmer is particularly passionate about addressing youth addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A tragedy that came out of Measure 110 is that there was no differentiation between youth and adults,\" she said. \"If a youth is caught with alcohol, they actually would get a minor in-possession charge. But if that same youth is caught with fentanyl, under Measure 110, that's decriminalized.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danielle Bethell, president of the Association of Oregon Counties, said she doesn't know any county commissioners who favor locking up drug addicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That's just not the narrative,\" Bethell said. \"The reality, though, is that everybody who has an addiction needs help. And most of them, if not all, need a nudge. And that nudge doesn't exist anymore.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/wild-west-long-police-wait-times-major-cities-leave-victims-feeling-helpless\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘THIS IS THE WILD WEST’: LONG POLICE WAIT TIMES IN MAJOR CITIES LEAVE VICTIMS FEELING HELPLESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yamhill County Sheriff Sam Elliott said his rural community had a \"very successful drug court program\" that helped people recover from addiction and avoid a felony conviction. Now, that's essentially nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When you give them a violation citation that they don't have to appear on . . . they don't come back in and have that interaction with those resources,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-stay-course-soft-heroin-laws-despite-skyrocketing-overdose-rates-drug-law-proponents\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Decriminalization advocates&lt;/a&gt; don’t want change, though, arguing the law is \"doing its part to address drug use and addiction with a health approach,\" according to the George Soros-backed Drug Policy Alliance, which poured millions into the campaign for Measure 110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our opponents are using it as a scapegoat for other, longstanding issues such as homelessness, crime, and public disorder,\" the group's website reads. The alliance did not respond to multiple interview requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at New York University's &lt;a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2809867?guestAccessKey=ed7fdba1-5494-4ba2-98df-e0f39a8c5313&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=092723\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;Grossman School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; wrote in a September paper that they found no evidence of an association between decriminalization and fatal overdose rates in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson, with the HIDTA, and Elliott both said it is difficult to attribute fentanyl’s rise in Oregon to Measure 110. The law took effect during the coronavirus pandemic, when overdose rates rose nationwide. And fentanyl has been ravaging east coast communities like Philadelphia’s notorious &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/crisis-kensington-opioids-hit-philadelphia-like-atomic-bomb-man-documenting-fallout\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Kensington neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; for nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Oregonians and their representatives seem unwilling to continue the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I really think there is an opportunity to completely course-correct,\" Maceira said, by \"not allowing people to use those deadly substances or be okay with it.\"&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Elon Musk &lt;/a&gt;has again railed against President Joe Biden’s approach to securing the southern border, arguing that the commander-in-chief is letting millions of people into the country on purpose, so the Democrats can permanently stay in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Musk, who has been a vocal critic of Biden’s border crisis, ripped into the president on X late Friday while sharing a 2021 news story headline revealing that Biden had intended to prioritize offering legal status to an estimated 11 million people while in office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/musk-hits-bidens-call-border-deal-no-laws-need-passed\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MUSK HITS OUT AT BIDEN’S CALL FOR BORDER DEAL: ‘NO LAWS NEED TO BE PASSED’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Biden’s strategy is very simple,\" Musk wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \"1. Get as many illegals in the country as possible. 2. Legalize them to create a permanent majority – a one-party state.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That is why they are encouraging so much illegal immigration. Simple, yet effective.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report for &lt;a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/doclib/eoy/iceAnnualReportFY2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;fiscal 2023&lt;/a&gt; shows that the number of illegal immigrants on the non-detained docket has soared from 3.7 million in FY 2021 to nearly 4.8 million in FY 2022 to nearly 6.2 million in FY 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk, a legal immigrant from South Africa, went on to pin his post to the top of his X page account, adding in the caption \"This explains why there are so few deportations, as every deportation is a lost vote.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As happened this week, you can literally assault police officers in broad daylight in New York, be released with no bail, give everyone the finger and *still* not be deported!! Outrageous.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He further commented on the migrant attack on two NYPD officers, writing it \"makes no sense\" after many of them were released on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What is even the point of arresting criminals if nothing is done!?\" Musk wrote later about a report on a Venezuelan woman who had been arrested eight times in the last six months. \"No prison, no deportation.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He previously argued that gaining asylum status after illegally crossing the southern border is as &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/elon-musk-says-he-supports-border-wall-that-migrants-must-have-shred-evidence-receive-asylum\"&gt;easy as a Google search.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk, the owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), also suggested that the influx of illegal immigrants will be used as a ruse for ballot harvesting in upcoming elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week the billionaire fired back at President Biden's calls for a bipartisan Senate deal to be passed to fix the unprecedented levels of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border. The bill is expected to include billions of dollars to Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/illegal-immigrant-population-soars-under-biden-government-data\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT POPULATION SOARS UNDER BIDEN: GOVERNMENT DATA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"No laws need to be passed,\" Musk wrote. \"All that is needed is an executive order to require proof before granting an asylum hearing. That is how it used to be.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also agreed with Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor David Sacks who wrote last week that the border is broken \"because this administration refuses to enforce the laws we already have.\" Musk responded by writing, \"exactly.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk visited the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/elon-musk-livestreams-border-give-people-firsthand-account-migrant-crisis\"&gt;southern border in Eagle Pass, Texas, in September&lt;/a&gt; and livestreamed what he saw, giving people a firsthand account of the migrant crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Biden told reporters he has done, \"all I can do\" with his executive authority to secure the border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Republicans are currently working to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/download\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La, said on the House floor last week that Biden and Mayorkas designed the \"catastrophe\" at the southern border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He’s inviting chaos and disorder within our land that is tearing at the very fabric of our society. The president can put a stop to this,\" Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"And now, rather than accept any accountability or responsibility for what they have clearly done, President Biden wants to somehow try to shift the blame to Congress for his administration’s catastrophe by design. It’s absolutely laughable. No one’s falling for this.\"&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever come across a diet that promises &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;rapid, short-term weight loss&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely, it's a fad diet that you should avoid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight doesn't happen overnight, and if a product or diet is promising it will, it'll probably end up doing more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/keep-weight-loss-journey-secret-everyone-say-experts-why\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEEP YOUR WEIGHT-LOSS JOURNEY A SECRET FROM EVERYONE, SAY EXPERTS. HERE'S WHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can be hard to tell if you are in the face of a fad diet or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, a fad diet will promote rapid weight loss, be short-term, exclude certain food groups, have no scientific backing, restrict the number of calories you can consume, and come with a strict set of rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at these &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;fad diets you should avoid&lt;/a&gt;, plus get tips for what to do instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HCG diet is widely considered to be an extremely unhealthy approach to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was created in the 1950s when British physician Albert Simeons started to promote the diet for weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It mainly comes with two requirements. The first is that you can only eat 500 calories each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second component to this diet is the human chorionic gonadotropin supplement taken daily. This medication is mainly used to treat fertility issues, according to Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration does not classify HCG supplements as safe for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/split-upper-lower-body-workout-days\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CELEBRITY FITNESS TRAINER GUNNAR PETERSON ON SPLITTING UPPER AND LOWER BODY WORKOUT ROUTINES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical News Today reports that HCG supplements can cause mood changes, fluid buildup in bodily tissues, enlarged breasts in males, and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low-calorie diet also comes with a slew of side effects like malnutrition, low mood, an irregular heartbeat and gallstones, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, the diet mainly &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;consists of cabbage soup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diet consists of eating cabbage soup for seven days with one to two other low-calorie foods daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diet is, for one, not sustainable, but it also lacks nutrients from major food groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it's such a short-term diet, there probably won't be any significant weight loss in the time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/workout-diet-tips-gain-muscle-lose-fat\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORKOUT AND DIET TIPS TO GAIN MUSCLE AND LOSE FAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diet lacks many &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;nutrients vital to overall health&lt;/a&gt;. Its restrictive nature, and the short time in which it's followed, cause people to regain the weight they lost once the week is up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/babies\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;baby food diet,&lt;/a&gt; like many fads, has roots in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diet has people reaching for the baby food in their cupboards and eating multiple jars for two meals a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While baby food contains enough nutrients for a young child, it does not have enough for a full-grown adult. Continuing this diet for a prolonged time can lead to nutrient deficiencies, according to Verywell Fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, after consuming even multiple jars of food for a meal, you'll probably still find yourself feeling hungry since it's so low in protein and fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Freshly squeezed juice&lt;/a&gt; filled with fruits and nutritious greens is great for you, but not when it's the only thing you are eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are drinking juice alone with no solid foods, a healthy product becomes unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juice cleanses can lead to dehydration and kidney problems, according to Health.com, as well as increased hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, when it comes to weight loss, the best thing you can do is create a healthy balance of a nutritious diet with all food groups and &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/fitness-and-wellbeing\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's vital to create realistic weight-loss goals for yourself and maintain an understanding that noticeable changes are going to take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"For most people, a realistic weight-loss goal is probably only going to be about four to eight pounds a month,\" Jessica Isaacs, a Los Angeles-based registered sports dietitian and Red Bull wellness adviser, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-rounded diet should keep all food groups in play while also keeping portions in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We want a balanced diet, really focusing on being mindful of portions, and then a high, daily, consistent protein intake is important. We can store carbs, we can store fat, we don't store protein,\" Isaacs added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's going to take time, balance and realistic goal-setting to lose weight and keep it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fad diets can be the source of quick solutions but not healthy, long-lasting ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    As the culture becomes increasingly secular, Lauren Green said she hopes her new devotional &amp;quot;Light for Today&amp;quot; can help people recognize God&amp;apos;s hand in everyday things.\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;Fox News Channel's chief religion correspondent, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/lauren-green\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Lauren Green&lt;/a&gt;, believes that the third millennium will be a \"coming together\" of Christianity as different denominations learn from each other today — especially at a time when the culture has become increasingly secular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is my theory,\" Green told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week. \"The first millennium of Christianity was, ‘Let’s try to figure out who Christ is, and everything.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second, she said, was \"everybody's just breaking up, thrown away\" — with thousands of different denominations emerging since the Protestant Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/faith-fire-dr-james-spencer-shares-recipe-christian-resistance\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITH FAITH UNDER FIRE TODAY, DR. JAMES SPENCER SHARES RECIPE FOR CHRISTIAN RESISTANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I do think this third millennium is really the coming together,\" she said. \"It's coming back. It's the apologetics. It is not just breathing the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;air of Christianity&lt;/a&gt; in a culture that's sort of immersed in it and not understanding why we believe what we believe.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, \"I think there's this movement to really educate people, to understand who God is and who Jesus is.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Protestant churches are adopting similar teaching ministries commonly found in Protestant congregations, noted Green — just as some Protestant churches are adopting more traditional liturgical practices as proof of how Christians see the value of each other's practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her new book, \"Light for Today,\" a 365-day devotional, Green hopes to help people see the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;work of God&lt;/a&gt; in their everyday lives and not just during religious services — and grow in a deeper understanding of God as as result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/catholic-church-faces-cultural-time-bishop-robert-barron-minnesota-models-thoughtful-faith\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS CATHOLIC CHURCH FACES PRECARIOUS CULTURAL TIME, BISHOP ROBERT BARRON OF MINNESOTA MODELS THOUGHTFUL FAITH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not initially set out to write a book of devotionals, said Green. Instead, she thought she was just posting thoughts and positivity each day on her Facebook page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After writing &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/lifestyle-books\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;her last book&lt;/a&gt;, \"Lighthouse Faith: God as a Living Reality in a World Immersed in Fog,\" she realized that she had much more to say — so she kept writing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I spent so many years researching and reading, but I was still in my mind, researching and reading,\" she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I wanted to increase my faith through writing,\" she said. That eventually took the form of reflections she shared on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years went by, and Green estimates that she published over 450 of these thoughts on her Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a publisher asked her if she would consider writing a devotional — and Green realized that she had already done a lot of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/hallow-prayer-app-accomplished-goal-gop-debate-company-pray-me-quick\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HALLOW PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE: ‘PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I said, ‘It just so happens that I have these thoughts for the day that probably could be edited very well into a 365-day devotional,’\" she told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the devotional, Green aims to drive home the point that \"God is &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a living reality&lt;/a&gt;.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This \"means you're molding your life to the reality of God,\" she said, something she considers \"an incredible challenge — to be a person of faith, to really understand who God is, and to mold my life to this God.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green also hopes to remind people that God is in control of the natural process. So even if miracles such as the parting of the Red Sea are not an everyday occurrence, that does not mean that God is not there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I think that's where it fascinated me to actually look at the everyday parts of life and to see, if every day, I could challenge myself to move closer to God, instead of moving further away from God,\" said Green. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/san-francisco-church-evangelizing-nones-great-impact\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO CHURCH IS EVANGELIZING TO THE ‘NONES’: CAN ‘HAVE GREAT IMPACT'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in today's world, she said, people of faith have a tendency to \"want to put God in a box.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, \"this devotional is this way of getting back into seeing God in the everyday,\" she said — not just an hour or two on the weekends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, there needs to be a mindset in which \"God is central, God is foremost,\" she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There must be an effort to resist the temptation to \"make God a concept\" that can be controlled, rather than \"the living reality that we have to mold our lives to,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything, Green explained, goes back to putting God first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"All of the laws, all of the Ten Commandments, hang on keeping God first,\" she said. \"They relate first to the First Commandment, and then, second, to each other.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Green, \"The First Commandment is ‘I am the Lord your God. You shall have no other gods before me.' That is a key to understanding who this God is.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Light-Today-Devotions-Lighthouse-Wisdom/dp/1424567289\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;Light for Today&lt;/a&gt;: 365 Daily Devotions from the Lighthouse – Hope and Wisdom for Life\" (Feb. 2024), follows Green's earlier book \"Lighthouse Faith,\" which was released in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green joined Fox News Channel in 1996.

Kate was bundled up in gray sweatpants, a black puffer jacket and a beanie with gloves as she made her way around Lake Norman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gosselin's fluffy, white pup was leashed close to her as she walked around her waterfront property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported Kate made the move from Pennsylvania to North Carolina in 2022.

Our kids are still my No. 1 priority. I love them and want to make sure they stay happy, healthy and safe. My job is being the best, most supportive and loving father that I can be to my kids, and not being married to Kate doesn’t change that,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This will be a difficult transition for all of us,\" Jon continued, \"but Kate and I will work out a schedule that enables our kids to have plenty of quality time with both of us at home in Pennsylvania. In terms of my marriage, it’s no secret that the past six months or so have been very difficult for Kate and me. We are no different than other couples and parents who are facing a crossroads in their marriage. I am, of course, deeply saddened that we are divorcing.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate filed for divorce two months after allegations of Jon cheating dominated headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Jon was photographed with Deanna Hummel. They both adamantly denied the cheating allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Collin, one of the sextuplets from \"Jon and Kate Plus 8,\" told Entertainment Tonight his relationship with his mom was severed after he was sent to the Fairmount Behavioral Health Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CvgSMClMdiW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jon-gosselin-claims-kate-gosselin-mentally-abused-son-collin\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Jon previously said&lt;/a&gt; Kate sent Collin to the Philadelphia institution, and he removed Collin in 2018. The 19-year-old has lived with Jon since and announced that, after his high school graduation in 2023, he planned to join the Marines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-gosselins-daughter-mady-accuses-brother-collin-violent-threats-family\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;KATE GOSSELIN'S DAUGHTER MADY ACCUSES BROTHER COLLIN OF RECENT VIOLENT THREATS AGAINST FAMILY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"After being there, I didn't have a relationship with her,\" Collin told the outlet. \"Even before [being] there, I don't think we had much of a relationship, and I think that just kept tearing it even more down.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collin told the outlet the pressure of his family being on a reality television show led to the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jon-gosselin-claims-ex-kate-stole-100000-from-two-kids-disgusting\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estrangement with Kate.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I want to believe it was because of TV and what being in the public eye does to a family. I think it tore us apart,\" he said. \"It gave us less time to actually be together as a family [and] more time to be in the public eye.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CsFYzgaMLVh/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his upbringing, Collin shared that his childhood \"was worse than what you would say the average teenage kid goes through with their parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I came to the conclusion that everybody has their own agenda, you know? My mom had her own agenda, and I don’t know exactly what that was. But I was put in a tough spot, and my agenda was to make it out on top of that tough spot.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collin revealed to the outlet he would like to have a relationship with Kate, who has since &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-gosselin-says-son-collin-very-troubled-young-man-after-abuse-allegations\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;responded to her son's allegations,&lt;/a&gt; in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's unfortunate that we didn't have a relationship,\" he said. \"I think every son wants to have a relationship with their mom. But I'm doing very well.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to moving to North Carolina in 2022, Kate lived in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the New York Post, Kate's 7,300-square-foot home sits on nearly 24 acres. The outlet also reported her 3,560-square-foot home in Pennsylvania had less than 1 acre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet reported in 2021 the Gosselin house, featured in \"Kate Plus Eight,\" sold for $1.085 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's rare to see Kate out and about in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to being seen in January, Gosselin was spotted walking her dog and pumping gas in her new home state in 2022. The Sun reported she obtained her North Carolina Board of Nursing license in June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to reality TV fame, she had been a labor and delivery nurse in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate appeared on the first episode of the first season of FOX's \"Special Forces: World's Toughest Test\" in January 2023. On the show, she went through boot camp-style physical training and challenges, but she withdrew early in the competition due to a medical issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gosselin was falling backward into water from a helicopter with her co-stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I landed right on my neck, and I screamed when I landed because it was absolute ridiculous pain,\" she told People last year. \"Then, at some point, I started feeling nauseous, and I was dry heaving over the edge into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Everyone by then on the cast was like, 'I think you should probably say something.' I was like, 'No,' because I knew if I said something I was going to ... well, I didn't know I was going to be out. So, I braved through it and it just kept getting worse.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injury ultimately led her to leave the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It took me so long to get over that,\" she told the outlet. \"I still don't think I am. Because I really wanted to challenge myself.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gosselin's appearance on \"Special Forces: World's Toughest Test\" was her first reality television appearance since \"Kate Plus Date\" in 2019. The six-episode show aired for one season. \"Kate Plus Date\" showcased Kate's dating journey a decade after her divorce from Jon.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Vice President Harris&lt;/a&gt;, on the eve of South Carolina's Democratic presidential nominating primary, highlighting the significance of the state's leadoff position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"South Carolina, you are the first primary in the nation and President Biden and I are counting on you,\" Harris said at a campaign event at South Carolina State University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Are you ready to make your voices heard,\" the vice president asked the crowd gathered Friday at the historically Black university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;South Carolina,&lt;/a&gt; where Black voters play an outsized role in state Democratic politics, for the first time is leading off the party's official presidential nominating calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/black-voters-saved-biden-twice-2020-will-they-turn-out-again-president-2024\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN AIMS TO SOLIDIFY SUPPORT AMONG BLACK VOTERS AT THE BALLOT BOX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And much of the credit goes to &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;President Biden,&lt;/a&gt; who orchestrated an upending of the Democratic National Committee's long-running nominating calendar to place the Palmetto State first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you ever doubt that the power to change America is in your hands, remember this. You proved it. You're the reason I am president. That's right. You're the reason Kamala Harris is a historic vice president,\" Biden emphasized last weekend as he spoke at a major South Carolina Democratic Party gathering.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haley-trump-trade-shots-over-whos-weakest-general-election-candidate-ever-take-biden\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HALEY, TRUMP, TRADE SHOTS OVER WHO'S THE WEAKER CANDIDATE AGAINST BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, the then-former vice president was reeling, after a fourth place finish in the Iowa caucuses and a fifth place showing in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-hampshire\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; primary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden rebounded with a distant second place finish to Sen. Bernie Sanders in Nevada's caucuses, which was followed by a landslide victory in the South Carolina primary. Biden's demolishing of the rest of the field of &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Democratic rivals&lt;/a&gt; - boosted in large part by the support of longtime Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina - rocketed Biden towards the party's nomination and eventually the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Democrats for years knocked both Iowa and New Hampshire - which led both national parties' nominating calendars for half a century - as unrepresentative of the party as a whole because the states have largely Caucasian populations with few major urban areas. Nevada and South Carolina, which in recent cycles voted third and fourth on the calendar, are much more diverse than either Iowa or New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haley-aims-finish-little-bit-closer-trump-south-carolinas-republican-presidential-primary\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HALEY SAYS ‘CLOSING THE GAP’ WITH TRUMP HER GOAL IN SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRIMARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Republicans didn't make major changes to their 2024 schedule, the DNC a year ago overwhelmingly approved a calendar proposed by Biden to move South Carolina to the lead position. The president and supporters of the new calendar argued that it would empower minority voters, upon whom Democrats have long relied but have at times taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of political analysts also saw the move as a thank you by Biden to Clyburn and South Carolina for the role they played in his 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Iowa eventually complied with the DNC, New Hampshire adhered to a half-century-old state law that mandates their presidential primary goes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire held its primary for both parties on Jan. 23, and the Democratic contest was unsanctioned by the DNC, with no delegates at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden didn't file to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot and didn't campaign in the state. But he still won over 60% of the vote in the contest, thanks to a well-funded write-in effort by top Granite State Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/download\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Biden's on the ballot in South Carolina, as are his two long-shot primary challengers, Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and Marianne Williamson, the best-selling author and spiritual adviser who's making her second straight White House run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillips, who captured nearly 20% of the vote in New Hampshire after heavily campaigning there, appears to have waved the white flag in South Carolina. Phillips last campaigned in the Palmetto State a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden's expected to once again carry South Carolina by a massive margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This primary is contested, but it isn't competitive,\" South Carolina Democratic Party chair Christale Spain told Fox News on Friday.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And spotlighting the significance of going first in the calendar, she said \"it means, for the first time in this country's history, that Black voters get to have their voices heard first in the process. Not later on. That southern voters get to go first. Rural voters get to go first. So it's a huge deal.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Nick Rojas contributed to this report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

But I’m not that surprised because I see it, I feel it,\" Trump argued as he campaigned in New Hampshire ahead of that state's presidential primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Trump suggested that \"there is much more enthusiasm now\" for him among minority voters, there's little polling evidence to back up his claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even a slight shift of voters from Biden to Trump - or the possibility of some Black voters frustrated with a lack of progress on key issues sitting out the 2024 election - could potentially make the difference in crucial battleground states like Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black voters carried Biden to a landslide victory in the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary four years ago, igniting his 2020 campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president, campaigning in South Carolina last weekend, thanked the largely Black audience at a state Democratic Party gathering for helping him win the White House, adding \"you’re the reason Donald Trump is a loser.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to his likely rematch with Trump in November, Biden told the crowd \"you’re the reason we’re going to win and beat him again.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sign of the importance of the Black vote, the president kicked off his reelection bid last month at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine Black parishioners were killed in a 2015 mass shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/download\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some Democratic leaders have been raising concerns regarding the president's underwhelming support among some Black voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain told Fox News the key is to get the message out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I do believe that it's not enthusiasm, it's information,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Spain predicted support would solidify \"once we share the information about how President Biden and the Democrats have been delivering on things.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Vice President Harri&lt;/a&gt;s, who made history as the nation's first female and Black vice president, told the crowd at a get-out-the-vote rally at a historically Black university in Orangeburg on the eve of the primary that \"South Carolina, you are the first primary in the nation and President Biden and I are counting on you.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And pointing to Trump, Harris argued that \"for years, the former president has stoked the fires of hate and bigotry and racism and xenophobia for his own power and political gain.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The former president has told us who he is, and it is on us, then, to recognize the profound threat he poses to our democracy and to our freedoms,\" she warned the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' James Levinson contributed to this report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "<p>Patrick Mahomes was drafted in the first round in 2017 and has been <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the Chiefs'</u></a> primary starting quarterback for the last six seasons. He is a two-time NFL MVP and has won a pair of Vince Lombardi Trophies.</p><p>Mahomes has also thrown for more than 4,000 yards in every season he has been the full-time starter. Next week, the 28-year-old signal caller will make his fourth Super Bowl appearance. Mahomes' impressive resume has already drawn comparisons to former New England Patriots quarterback <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Brady</a>. </p><p>While Brady is widely considered the greatest player in NFL history, others argue that Mahomes has already reached the seven-time Super Bowl champion's level of greatness. But, Mahomes' father, Pat Mahomes Sr., is not quite ready to give his son the greatest of all-time title.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p><p>\"That's still to be determined,\" the elder Mahomes said. \"He still has a ways to go. I have mad respect for Tom Brady and I grew up as a Joe Montana fan.\"</p><p>Mahomes Sr. did acknowledge that his son is heading in the right direction, but at this point, he would still give Brady and Montana the edge.</p><p>\"[Patrick] is on the right trajectory, but right now, I would still say those guys are better.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-justin-reid-argues-patrick-mahomes-leagues-goat-probably-best-player-nfl-history\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CHIEFS' JUSTIN REID ARGUES PATRICK MAHOMES IS LEAGUE'S GOAT: 'PROBABLY THE BEST PLAYER IN NFL HISTORY'</strong></a></p><p>There are some similarities between Mahomes' path and Brady's and Montana's accomplishments when they were the same age as the Chiefs quarterback. Montana won his second <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/super-bowl\" target=\"_blank\">Super Bowl</a> in his late 20s, while Brady won three titles by the time he turned 28-years-old.</p><p>However, Brady nor Montana were named an <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-mvp-other-award-finalists-named-season-winds-down\" target=\"_blank\">NFL MVP</a> until they were in their 30s. Mahomes earned his first league MVP trophy in 2018 and his second in 2022. It is important to point out that Montana played in a different era. The rules of the game were vastly different during his time and high-powered passing attacks were uncommon.</p><p>Longtime Patriots team owner <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/patriots-robert-kraft-weighs-tom-brady-patrick-mahomes-comparisons\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Kraft</a> recently attended the MusiCares Gala to present Jon Bon Jovi with the Person of tht Year award. Kraft weighed in on the quarterback comparisons. </p><p>\"They’re both off the charts. I had a personal relationship and great love for Tom Brady,\" Kraft told Fox News Digital on the red carpet. \"I think if Patrick is pretty special, and he can evolve and sustain the way Tom did – it looks like he’s on the path – that’s great.</p><p>\"But what I’d also like about him is I’ve heard, and the little I’ve seen, he’s a great human being – the way Tommy’s off the charts. And that’s great for America, that two people who are so accomplished can be so good representatives to young people.\"</p><p>Brady's longevity was unprecedented, and it is difficult to project whether Mahomes will be able to sustain excellence for more than two decades.</p><p>The Chiefs defeated the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Miami Dolphins</u></a> inside a frigid Arrowhead Stadium in the wild-card round. Kansas City proceeded to beat the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round game, and the Baltimore Ravens in last week's conference title game.</p><p>Mahomes will try and win his third ring when the Chiefs and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco 49ers</a> face off in Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas on February 11.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s</i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\"><i><u> sports coverage on X</u></i></a><i><u>,</u> and subscribe to</i><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><i><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></i></a><i>.</i></p>\n",

The puppet screamed after him, \"Mr. Larry, Elmo liked you before!\" As the co-hosts processed the scene that just happened behind them, the puppet called back out to David, saying, \"Let’s get back on the couch and let’s talk about how you’re feeling!\"</p><p>Co-host Savannah Guthrie told David, \"Larry, you’ve gone too far this time,\" to which he replied, \"Somebody had to do it.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/sesame-street-prompts-strong-reaction-pride-month-twitter-posts-happy-pride-elmo-loves-you\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>SESAME STREET PROMPTS STRONG REACTION WITH PRIDE MONTH TWITTER POSTS: ‘HAPPY PRIDE!

I was waiting to be interviewed, and Elmo – he was going on about mental health and I had to listen to every word.\"</p><p>Using a high-pitched voice to mock the puppet, he continued, \"And I was going, ‘Oh my God, oh my God, I don’t think I can take another second of this!’\" Returning to his normal voice, he yelled, \"And so I got off my chair and I approached him and I throttled him!\"</p><p>\"There you go,\" an amused Meyers remarked. </p><p>\"I couldn’t take it!\" David said, adding, \"And you know what? I would do it again.\"</p><p>The Elmo altercation happened after the Sesame Street star went viral on X this week for asking his 500 thousand followers how they were feeling. The innocent question sparked a social media conversation on mental health that even <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-blasted-sharing-elmos-social-media-post-puppet-endorsing-another-puppet\" target=\"_blank\">President Biden</a> felt was important enough to weigh in on. </p>\n",

The program is intended to replace the current food service provided there, the Post reported.</p><p>\"Not only will this provide families with the ability to purchase fresh food for their culturally relevant diets and the baby supplies of their choosing, but the pilot program is expected to save New York City more than $600,000 per month, or more than $7.2 million annually,\" a spokesperson for New York City Mayor Eric Adams told the paper in a statement.</p><p>City Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-migrant-flips-middle-fingers-charged-attacking-nypd-times-square\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ILLEGAL MIGRANT FLIPS MIDDLE FINGERS AFTER BEING CHARGED WITH ATTACKING NYPD IN TIMES SQUARE</strong></a></p><p>The pre-paid cards may only be used at bodegas, grocery stores, supermarkets and convenience stores. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants\" target=\"_blank\">Migrants eligible</a> for the program must sign an affidavit stating they will only spend the funds on food and baby supplies, or else they would lose access to the funds, the report said. </p><p>The amount available to each migrant family depends on their size and how much income they are receiving, according to the contract reviewed by the Post. A family of four might be provided nearly $1,000 each month, or $35 per day for food, the Post reported.

Other drugs such as Adderall and Modafinal — while used widely to treat ADHD — can be used to enhance cognition.  </p><p>And a favorite of mine: optogenetics, a technique that makes neurons fire when they are exposed to light. Yes, there’s a big issue getting a flashlight into your cranium. But if we can do that, the technique presents all kinds of possibilities for cognitive enhancement. Flip a switch and watch your IQ tick up. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/andrew-yang-warns-us-not-doing-enough-prepare-for-ais-impact-dramatic-changes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ANDREW YANG WARNS US 'NOT DOING ENOUGH' TO PREPARE FOR AI'S IMPACT: 'DRAMATIC CHANGES'</strong></a></p><p>Cognitive enhancement does not only take our thinking up a notch — it also <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values\" target=\"_blank\">may help us understand moral concerns</a> that are opaque to us now. Think of it this way: your dog has very little appreciation of morality. Sure, maybe he can understand that snacking on Thanksgiving dinner before the meal makes him a \"very, very bad dog.\" And that letting the neighbor kids pet him even though (you’ll admit) they are kind of annoying makes him a \"good dog.\"  </p><p>But try chatting with Fido about rights or equality or the ethics of technology, and you’ll get a blank stare. Why? There are probably a few reasons. The most obvious: a human adult has a more sophisticated intellect, and so is better able to appreciate and understand morality than a dog ever could.   </p><p>My point? Our cognitively enhanced future cousins may stand in relation to us as we stand in relation to our dogs. Better able to appreciate moral nuances that escape us because of our cognitive inferiority. Dumbfounded in the face of moral considerations that, at our current cognitive level, simply do not click.  </p><p>But here’s the thing: none of this would actually make us more moral. The boosted IQ, the sharper memory, the greater appreciation of moral concerns. None of it. The reason is simple. Merely understanding morality does not make you morally better.  </p><p>Two thousand years ago, Aristotle had a word for this: akrasia, knowing the right thing to do but lacking the will to do it. Just because our future, enhanced cousins may understand and appreciate morality better does not mean they’ll act any better. They very well may know the right thing to do — and know it better than we do — but then choose to do something else entirely. That’s Aristotle’s lesson.  </p><p>More recently, the University of California, Riverside professor Eric Schwitzgebel has made the same point in a different way: through a series of studies about the moral behavior of ethicists. Presumably, ethicists know more about morality than your average Joe. They study ethics all day, after all. And yet, in study after tongue-in-cheek study, Schwitzgebel has shown professional ethicists to be not any better — or a bit worse — than the rest of us.  </p><p>Professional ethicists fail to return library books more often than others, vote at a comparable rate to peers, talk at the same rate during other professors’ talks, and leave trash behind in meeting rooms at the same rate as anyone else.  </p><p>Does this make ethicists moral monsters? Obviously not. But it does suggest that simply knowing more about morality won’t make you a better person. That goes for professional ethicists. It goes for our enhanced future cousins. And it goes for us, too — the unenhanced masses. </p><p>Really, though, we didn’t need either Aristotle or Schwitzgebel to show us this. Being smarter doesn’t make you more moral. We’ve all known the wicked smart jerk, the GPA-crushing roommate who is impossible to live with, the genius with the soured personality.  </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</strong></a></p><p>Moreover, any moral outlook that recognizes the equal dignity of all humans suggests there is something obscene about assuming that moral worth tags along with IQ. This would imply, after all, that those with a lower IQ are morally inferior. A clear violation of human dignity.  </p><p>So how could we become better morally? One possibility: when it comes to enhancement technologies, skip smarts and go right for morality. Forget about enhancing IQ and instead target empathy. Or altruism. Or simply those traits associated with a sunny disposition. There’s some chance this could work.  </p><p>If it did, our enhanced future cousins could be tweaked so they would not only know more than us about morality, but have a better moral compass. There’s a problem: a moral compass is only good if you want to follow where it points. And it isn’t clear how any form of enhancement could convince people to go where their enhanced compass is pointing. </p><p>The better way forward? The tried-and-true paths that are available to us right now. Study trusted moral advice and aim to live it out; engage in your local communities; learn to appreciate the beautiful and allow your vision of it inform your life; engage in religious practice; seek out solid education; serve the poor, the vulnerable, the underserved.  </p><p>That’s the path to moral sainthood, and it is a path that has neither been undermined nor surpassed by Neuralink. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/person/v/joseph-vukov\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOSEPH VUKOV</u></strong></a></p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Fifteen years ago, I learned a lesson about lending money the hard way. A relative of mine hit <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance\" target=\"_blank\">difficult times in their finances</a> and asked me for a $10,000 loan. You might be familiar with the situation. The family hit hard times, mostly from their own doing. Job layoff. Financially damaging relationship. Overspending on luxury goods and trips they couldn’t afford. </p><p>So, why ask me for a loan? Or better yet, why not me? They knew <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/investment\" target=\"_blank\">my family was having financial success.</a> They knew we had just bought a big house. Nobody ever takes your money as seriously as their own money.  </p><p>I’ll never forget what he asked me. \"I just need a small loan of $10,000 to get me through this patch and I promise that I’ll repay you in the next few months.\" With one of the biggest mistakes of my life, I told him yes to the $10,000 loan. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/almost-60-parents-still-giving-adult-kids-money-while-majority-adult-kids-live-home-survey\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ALMOST 60% OF PARENTS STILL GIVING THEIR ADULT KIDS MONEY, WHILE MAJORITY OF ADULT KIDS LIVE AT HOME: SURVEY</strong></a></p><p>No thank you note. No thank you e-mail. No follow up after my money hit his bank account. A few months later, things just got weirder. No follow-up. No payback plans. No communication at all. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting/family\" target=\"_blank\">At our family Thanksgiving festivities,</a> not even a mention of the loan at all.  </p><p>All I kept thinking was, \"when is he going to just tell me where we are at and when I’ll get my money back?\" After Thanksgiving and beyond … just crickets. From that point forward, our relationship became increasingly strained to the point that he never recovered financially, and I never recovered emotionally. So, we just don’t talk anymore. </p><p>Here are some rules to follow for loans with friends or family: </p><p>Adopt a Nancy Reagan '80s slogan of, \"Just Say No!\" It is best to tell people you don’t have it; you can’t afford it, or you simply don’t want to jeopardize your relationship with them. Those answers will solve 90% of the problems you’ll have with loaning people money. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</u></strong></a></p><p>You’ll feel better if you just call it what it is, which is a gift. If it is a gift, then you don’t quite have the same level of pressure because, essentially, you are saying that you’ll give somebody money with no strings attached. That means you could be helping a friend through a tough time or a family member who is having trouble paying for their kids’ college. You might feel better about it. </p><p>Make it official. The challenge becomes when you do an unofficial loan. This means you may not be clear about the terms of the loan (i.e. interest rate, repayment terms). Now, imagine this scenario. You loan money to a friend or a family member (much like an \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" episode), and then they book themselves a four-day trip to Las Vegas.  </p><p>Then, every time you see them at any event, you’ll always be wondering in the back of your head … \"When am I going to get my money back?\" You should get a legal contract in place in terms of a promissory note, so you have documentation. </p><p>It’s business now, get ready for the relationship to be strained if they miss payments. If the loan goes south and your friend cannot pay it back, how will you handle the relationship going forward? Almost 50% of the adults who lent money to friends or family report having a negative outcome, 37% said that they lost money, and 21% experienced a damaged relationship with the borrower.  </p><p>No co-signing a loan. Period.  When you co-sign a loan, it isn’t just about lending your credit reputation to help somebody else. It’s an actual financial commitment and a promise to repay their loan if they are unable to do so. This could include late fees, collection costs, and potentially wreak havoc on your credit score. </p><p>If you keep hearing the line from someone that you loaned money, \"Don’t worry, I’ll repay you soon!\" You might just get caught between whether you write off the loan or write off the friendship.   </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/person/j/ted-jenkin\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY TED JENKIN</strong></a></p>\n",

Most pedestrians keep their eyes trained straight ahead as they walk past clouds of fentanyl smoke or slumped figures with lolling heads. Maybe they cross the street or look sidelong at someone who starts shouting or throwing things.</p><p>But Nikki is different.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/crisis-northwest-voters-beyond-turning-point-decades-progressive-politics\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: ARE VOTERS 'BEYOND A TURNING POINT' AFTER DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICS?</strong></a></p><p>\"Are you okay? Are you sleeping?\" she called out, approaching a cocooned form next to the light rail tracks. Somewhere inside the sleeping bag, a man grunted in response.</p><p>Nikki, who has <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/homeless-crisis\" target=\"_blank\">been homeless</a> for two and a half years, repeats this process any time she sees someone lying on the ground, making sure they're responsive.</p><p>Fentanyl \"literally makes people so careless that they will stand over someone who is dead or dying and continue to get high,\" she said. It happened to one of her friends, a man in his mid-20s who appeared to be sleeping, but had died.</p><p>\"They were gonna have a lot of life left,\" she added.</p><p>Oregon has turned into a battlefield in the war over drug policy since the state became the first to decriminalize drug possession. Nearly 60% of voters approved Measure 110 but, three years later, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/voters-remorse-blue-state-survey-shows-majority-want-re-criminalize-drugs-made-enormous-mistake\" target=\"_blank\">numerous polls</a> suggest they regret that move. And no other states have followed Oregon's lead, despite assurances from researchers and decriminalization advocates that the law is not responsible for increased addiction, overdoses and crime.</p><p>State lawmakers are poised to re-criminalize drug possession in a special legislative session that begins Monday, though Democrats and Republicans have drafted competing bills. And Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek declared a 90-day state of emergency this week in downtown Portland, where the fentanyl crisis has been most pronounced.</p><p>\"Our country and our state have never seen a drug this deadly and addictive, and all are grappling with how to respond,\" Kotek, a Democrat, said in a release. \"We are all in this together.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/digital-originals\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE</u></strong></a></p><p>Fentanyl strikes fear among even longtime drug users.</p><p>\"This is creating zombies,\" Lori, a homeless woman <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/homeless-encampments-remain-portland-despite-tent-ban-bulls\" target=\"_blank\">in Portland</a>, told Fox News last summer. \"This sh-- should be illegal because they're killing the mentally ill for a dollar a pill, because I guarantee ya, all these people have some kind of mental illness.\"</p><p>Michael Dusek, who uses marijuana and meth, agreed.</p><p>\"They’re incoherent most of the time, they’re babbling about something to themselves quite loudly, like they can’t hear themselves,\" said Dusek, who has been homeless off and on since 1992. \"They’re like living dead.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/let-serve-warning-anarchists-claim-responsibility-burning-car-outside-city-leaders-home\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>'LET THIS SERVE AS A WARNING': ANARCHISTS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR BURNING CAR OUTSIDE CITY LEADER'S HOME</u></strong></a></p><p>Overdose deaths in the state surged from 800 in 2020 to 1,394 in 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The overwhelming majority of fatal overdoses are now attributed to fentanyl, according to Oregon health data.</p><p>\"It seems like we got all of Oregon coming, just to pick up fentanyl now,\" Dusek said of Portland.</p><p>Decriminalization advocates point out that fatal overdoses surged across the country beginning in early 2020, not just in Oregon. Many analysts attribute the spike to isolation and despair during the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>Nikki said she has revived 32 people in the past year, collecting as many <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/college-students-get-free-naloxone-fentanyl-test-strips-schools-prevent-drug-overdoses\" target=\"_blank\">doses of naloxone</a> as she can from clinics, shelters and even places where citizens have \"just nailed a box to a tree or to a wall and keep it stocked with Narcan.\"</p><p>Most fentanyl users Fox News spoke to were difficult — if not impossible — to understand. One woman chattered breathlessly while absently sorting syringes inside her tent, one hand protected by a blue latex glove. A 27-year-old man muttered that he was originally from Idaho, then lived on the Yakama Indian Reservation before a family member dropped him off in Portland so he could \"live homeless and do drugs.\"</p><p>\"Most of them are mentally ill, and the families don't wanna take care of them,\" Lori said. \"Or they're sick and old and their families don't take care of 'em.\"</p><p>Methamphetamine was historically Oregon’s drug of choice. But around 2018, law enforcement started to see a trickle of fentanyl, and then a surge, outpacing cocaine, heroin and meth. The small blue pills looked like Oxycodone and were filling the void left after states cracked down on opioid prescriptions.</p><p>And they were cheap to produce.</p><p>\"It doesn't take a whole lot of fentanyl to meet the supply side for particular users to give them the effects that they want,\" said Chris Gibson, executive director of the Oregon-Idaho High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA).</p><p>The number of pills law enforcement seized soared from about 100,000 in 2019, to more than 3 million in 2022, according to HIDTA's annual report. And while preliminary data from 2023 shows the increase in pill seizures slowing, powder seizures more than tripled last year. Police who participate in the HIDTA reported finding more than 180 kg (nearly 400 lbs) of fentanyl powder, Gibson said.</p><p>\"When you start thinking about the fact that it's estimated that two milligrams of fentanyl is a lethal dose to a new user<strong>,</strong> we start seeing the dangers of that,\" Gibson said.</p><p>The ingredients to make fentanyl are typically shipped from China to Mexico, Gibson said, then the finished product makes its way up the I-5 corridor from border to border, fanning out along the way.</p><p>\"Oregon can't control the southern border, but we have Honduran cartel members all in our urban areas pushing deadly fentanyl,\" <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/focus-merit-oregon-county-axes-diversity-office-cost-nearly-1-million-year\" target=\"_blank\">Clackamas County Commissioner</a> Ben West said. \"We can't control that. But that costs Oregonians lives, and it causes a lot of criminality and despair.\"</p><p>But Oregon can control its drug policies, West said, and \"elections have consequences.\"</p><p>Measure 110 made possession of user amounts of all drugs, including fentanyl, a Class E violation, punishable by a $100 fine that could be waived if the suspect called a hotline and completed a treatment assessment. But it quickly became apparent that drug users were not calling the hotline or paying the fine.</p><p>The other major part of the law — and one that many decriminalization critics want to keep — was redirecting a large chunk of the state's marijuana tax revenue to pay for addiction services, theoretically improving access to treatment. But that rollout was beleaguered by bureaucratic flubs and a tight implementation timeline. </p><p>Oregon approved $264 million in grants for more than 200 service providers as of December, according to the most recent audit from the <a href=\"https://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=215067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>Secretary of State’s office,</u></a> which found issues with oversight and noted it has been difficult to demonstrate the new law's effectiveness. </p><p>Many Oregon voters feel duped.</p><p>\"I voted for it because I thought it would reclassify drug crimes and allow people to get into treatment, and then it would be treatment-focused,\" <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/portlands-crime-crisis-soros-backed-da-creating-lawless-free-mentality-trial-attorney-says\" target=\"_blank\">Kristin Olson</a>, an attorney and host of the Rational in Portland podcast, previously told Fox News.</p><p>But the majority of users who take advantage of Measure 110 funds are accessing harm reduction supplies like clean needles, pipes and Naloxone. Residential treatment and detox centers were not prioritized in grant spending, raising alarm among some providers, according to a recent audit of the measure.</p><p>\"In Oregon, it's really easy to get high and really, really hard to get treatment,\" West said. \"You would think we would want to reverse that culturally.\"</p><p>Providers that \"required sobriety for housing or supportive employment\" were more likely to have their grant applications denied for not being \"in line\" with the spirit of the law, the audit also found.</p><p>\"There's a lot of money that is being put into out of sight, out of mind programs,\" said Matt Maceira, who suffered from addiction and frequent homelessness for 27 years. \"The money's wasted is what I'm saying.\"</p><p>After getting sober, Maceira founded Be Bold Street Ministries, a Christ-centered nonprofit. Volunteers can often be found praying with those living in one of Oregon's biggest encampments, just across the Wilamette River from the state capitol. They tell them about shelter and detox options and, on a cold Friday in January, helped a 28-year-old meth user call and register for treatment.</p><p>Maceira opposed Measure 110 from the start.</p><p>\"The decriminalization of deadly, mind-altering substances — you know what that will never produce? Decreased crime, increased public safety and lives saved,\" he said. \"But that's what was promised.\"</p><p>He said drug use is rampant at the low-barrier shelters prioritized by Measure 110.</p><p>\"People are dying in those places. I've done celebrations-of-life services for people that have overdosed at low-barrier shelters,\" he said, adding that he would rather see providers require sobriety.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/portland-leaders-frustrated-say-city-allowed-set-harsher-rules-cigarettes-fentanyl-insane\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PORTLAND LEADERS FRUSTRATED, SAY CITY ALLOWED TO SET HARSHER RULES FOR CIGARETTES THAN FENTANYL: ‘IT’S INSANE’</strong></a></p><p>\"Letting people use methamphetamine, fentanyl and heroin or any other deadly substance is not compassionate,\" he said. \"Having a rule that says, 'Hey, government money is paying for this, you can't use drugs here,' is a really loving message. Like, I actually care about you. I don't want to see you be another statistic.\"</p><p>Democrats, who control both chambers of the state legislature, have signaled they want to make drug possession a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/open-air-drug-use-overdoses-push-democrats-introduce-overhaul-first-nation-decriminalization-law\" target=\"_blank\">Class C misdemeanor</a>, the lowest crime classification available in the state. Their proposal offers numerous off-ramps for those caught with drugs to avoid charges.</p><p>Republicans, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blue-state-republicans-move-strike-catastrophic-drug-law-say-wreaking-havoc-communities\">released a bill</a> that would make possession of drugs like fentanyl, heroin and meth a Class A misdemeanor and would require treatment to avoid jail. If convicted, drug users could face up to a year behind bars, a $6,250 fine, or both. They argue the stiffer penalties are necessary to incentivize people to get clean.</p><p>Lawmakers will meet for a short session beginning February 5. It’s not clear whether the sides can compromise.</p><p>\"We’re not looking to put a Band-Aid on something,\" GOP Rep. Lucetta Elmer said. \"We’re looking to actually see effective change.\"</p><p>Elmer is particularly passionate about addressing youth addiction.</p><p>\"A tragedy that came out of Measure 110 is that there was no differentiation between youth and adults,\" she said. \"If a youth is caught with alcohol, they actually would get a minor in-possession charge. But if that same youth is caught with fentanyl, under Measure 110, that's decriminalized.\"</p><p>Danielle Bethell, president of the Association of Oregon Counties, said she doesn't know any county commissioners who favor locking up drug addicts.</p><p>\"That's just not the narrative,\" Bethell said. \"The reality, though, is that everybody who has an addiction needs help. And most of them, if not all, need a nudge. And that nudge doesn't exist anymore.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/wild-west-long-police-wait-times-major-cities-leave-victims-feeling-helpless\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>‘THIS IS THE WILD WEST’: LONG POLICE WAIT TIMES IN MAJOR CITIES LEAVE VICTIMS FEELING HELPLESS</strong></a></p><p>Yamhill County Sheriff Sam Elliott said his rural community had a \"very successful drug court program\" that helped people recover from addiction and avoid a felony conviction. Now, that's essentially nonexistent.</p><p>\"When you give them a violation citation that they don't have to appear on . . . they don't come back in and have that interaction with those resources,\" he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-stay-course-soft-heroin-laws-despite-skyrocketing-overdose-rates-drug-law-proponents\" target=\"_blank\">Decriminalization advocates</a> don’t want change, though, arguing the law is \"doing its part to address drug use and addiction with a health approach,\" according to the George Soros-backed Drug Policy Alliance, which poured millions into the campaign for Measure 110.</p><p>\"Our opponents are using it as a scapegoat for other, longstanding issues such as homelessness, crime, and public disorder,\" the group's website reads. The alliance did not respond to multiple interview requests.</p><p>Researchers at New York University's <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2809867?guestAccessKey=ed7fdba1-5494-4ba2-98df-e0f39a8c5313&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=092723\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grossman School of Medicine</a> wrote in a September paper that they found no evidence of an association between decriminalization and fatal overdose rates in Oregon.</p><p>Gibson, with the HIDTA, and Elliott both said it is difficult to attribute fentanyl’s rise in Oregon to Measure 110. The law took effect during the coronavirus pandemic, when overdose rates rose nationwide. And fentanyl has been ravaging east coast communities like Philadelphia’s notorious <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/crisis-kensington-opioids-hit-philadelphia-like-atomic-bomb-man-documenting-fallout\" target=\"_blank\">Kensington neighborhood</a> for nearly a decade.</p><p>But Oregonians and their representatives seem unwilling to continue the experiment.</p><p>\"I really think there is an opportunity to completely course-correct,\" Maceira said, by \"not allowing people to use those deadly substances or be okay with it.\"</p>\n",

Outrageous.\"</p><p>He further commented on the migrant attack on two NYPD officers, writing it \"makes no sense\" after many of them were released on bail.</p><p>\"What is even the point of arresting criminals if nothing is done!?\" Musk wrote later about a report on a Venezuelan woman who had been arrested eight times in the last six months. \"No prison, no deportation.\"</p><p>He previously argued that gaining asylum status after illegally crossing the southern border is as <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/elon-musk-says-he-supports-border-wall-that-migrants-must-have-shred-evidence-receive-asylum\">easy as a Google search.</a> </p><p>Musk, the owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), also suggested that the influx of illegal immigrants will be used as a ruse for ballot harvesting in upcoming elections. </p><p>Last week the billionaire fired back at President Biden's calls for a bipartisan Senate deal to be passed to fix the unprecedented levels of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border.

That eventually took the form of reflections she shared on social media. </p><p>Years went by, and Green estimates that she published over 450 of these thoughts on her Facebook page.</p><p>Eventually, a publisher asked her if she would consider writing a devotional — and Green realized that she had already done a lot of the work.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/hallow-prayer-app-accomplished-goal-gop-debate-company-pray-me-quick\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>HALLOW PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE: ‘PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK’</u></strong></a> </p><p>\"I said, ‘It just so happens that I have these thoughts for the day that probably could be edited very well into a 365-day devotional,’\" she told Fox News Digital. </p><p>With the devotional, Green aims to drive home the point that \"God is <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion\" target=\"_blank\">a living reality</a>.\" </p><p>This \"means you're molding your life to the reality of God,\" she said, something she considers \"an incredible challenge — to be a person of faith, to really understand who God is, and to mold my life to this God.\" </p><p>Green also hopes to remind people that God is in control of the natural process. So even if miracles such as the parting of the Red Sea are not an everyday occurrence, that does not mean that God is not there. </p><p>\"I think that's where it fascinated me to actually look at the everyday parts of life and to see, if every day, I could challenge myself to move closer to God, instead of moving further away from God,\" said Green. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/san-francisco-church-evangelizing-nones-great-impact\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SAN FRANCISCO CHURCH IS EVANGELIZING TO THE ‘NONES’: CAN ‘HAVE GREAT IMPACT'</strong></a></p><p>Sometimes in today's world, she said, people of faith have a tendency to \"want to put God in a box.\"</p><p>Rather, \"this devotional is this way of getting back into seeing God in the everyday,\" she said — not just an hour or two on the weekends. </p><p>Instead, there needs to be a mindset in which \"God is central, God is foremost,\" she said. </p><p>There must be an effort to resist the temptation to \"make God a concept\" that can be controlled, rather than \"the living reality that we have to mold our lives to,\" she said.</p><p>Everything, Green explained, goes back to putting God first. </p><p>\"All of the laws, all of the Ten Commandments, hang on keeping God first,\" she said. \"They relate first to the First Commandment, and then, second, to each other.\" </p><p>Said Green, \"The First Commandment is ‘I am the Lord your God.
